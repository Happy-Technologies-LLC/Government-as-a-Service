## 3. Iconography

A consistent icon style is essential. For this type of professional visualization, line-art icons work best.

### Recommended Libraries:

1.  **Lucide Icons ([https://lucide.dev/](https://lucide.dev/)):** **(Highly Recommended)** A beautiful, open-source icon library with a clean, consistent, and modern feel. It's a fork of the popular Feather Icons and is perfect for this project's aesthetic.
2.  **Heroicons ([https://heroicons.com/](https://heroicons.com/)):** Created by the makers of Tailwind CSS, these icons are designed to fit perfectly within a modern, utility-first design system. They offer solid and outline styles.
3.  **Font Awesome (Current):** While versatile, ensure you use a consistent style (e.g., all "Solid" or all "Regular") to maintain a cohesive look. The current implementation uses Font Awesome. For a brand refresh, switching to Lucide would be a significant visual upgrade.

## 4. Visual Style

* **Layout:** Use generous whitespace to avoid clutter and improve readability.
* **Depth:** Apply subtle shadows (`shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`) to create a sense of depth on cards and interactive elements.
* **Corners:** Use rounded corners (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`) for a modern, friendly feel.
* **Data Visualization:** Charts and graphs should be clean and easy to read. Use the accent colors to highlight key data points. Label everything clearly.
