## Executive Summary

This Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) template provides a systematic methodology for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating privacy risks in government digital services and data sharing initiatives. It ensures that privacy considerations are embedded throughout the project lifecycle, from design to implementation and ongoing operation.

**When to Use This Template:**
- New digital services collecting personal data
- Changes to existing services affecting data handling
- Data sharing arrangements between agencies
- Implementation of new technologies (AI/ML, biometrics, IoT)
- Large-scale data processing (>100,000 individuals)

## Part 1: PIA Overview and Methodology

### 1.1 Purpose of Privacy Impact Assessment

A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a structured process to:

1. **Identify privacy risks** before they materialize
2. **Design privacy protections** into systems from the outset
3. **Demonstrate compliance** with privacy laws and principles
4. **Build public trust** through transparency and accountability
5. **Enable informed decision-making** by leadership

### 1.2 When PIA is Required

**Mandatory PIA Required For:**
- [ ] New digital service collecting personal data
- [ ] Modification to existing service significantly changing data handling
- [ ] Data sharing between two or more agencies
- [ ] Processing sensitive personal data (health, financial, biometric, children)
- [ ] Automated decision-making affecting individuals
- [ ] Large-scale processing (>100,000 individuals)
- [ ] Use of new technologies with privacy implications (AI, facial recognition, location tracking)
- [ ] Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas (CCTV, sensors)

**Recommended PIA (Best Practice):**
- [ ] Medium-scale processing (10,000-100,000 individuals)
- [ ] Processing data about vulnerable populations
- [ ] Cross-border data transfers
