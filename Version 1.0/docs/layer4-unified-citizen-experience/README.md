# Layer 4: Unified Citizen Experience

**Architecture Layer:** Layer 4 (Top Layer - Citizen-Facing)
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Overview

Layer 4 represents the **unified front-door** to government—the single, seamless, omnichannel experience through which citizens access all public services. This is where the People-Process-Technology architecture (Layers 0-3) manifests as intuitive digital services, proactive notifications, and personalized interactions.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Unified Portal** - Single point of access (web, mobile, voice, in-person)
- **Once-Only Principle** - Citizens never re-enter data government already has
- **Proactive Services** - Government anticipates needs based on life events
- **Omnichannel Delivery** - Meet citizens where they are
- **Community Hub** - Co-design methodology for continuous improvement
