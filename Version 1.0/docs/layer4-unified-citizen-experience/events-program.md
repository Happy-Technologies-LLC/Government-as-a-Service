### 2.4 Summit Budget and Revenue

**Year 1 (500 attendees) Budget - Reality Check:**

⚠️ **EVENT LOGISTICS REALITY:** Someone who's actually run a 500-person international conference needs to review these numbers.

**Revenue (Realistic Scenario):**
- Registration: $280K (250 govt @ $500, 80 corporate @ $1,500, 40 students @ $250, 130 speakers/sponsors free)
  - **Reality:** 40-50% no-show rate for free registrations (budget conservatively)
  - **Reality:** Early corporate interest is soft. Expect 80-100 paid corporate, not 100+
- Sponsorships: $250K (1 Platinum $100K, 2 Gold $50K, 2 Silver $25K)
  - **Reality:** Year 1 sponsorships are hard to sell. $400K requires 8-10 months of sales effort
  - **Mitigation:** Start sales 12 months before event, not 6 months
- Grants: $100K (if secured - not guaranteed)
- **Total Revenue: $530-$630K** (vs. $850K projected)

**Expenses (Real Costs from Conference Planners):**
- Venue rental: $150K (Dubai is expensive. $100K is optimistic.)
- Catering: $200K ($80-$100 per person per day × 3 days × 500 people)
  - **Reality:** Middle East catering costs are higher. Dubai venue catering is not negotiable.
- AV and production: $100K (live streaming, recording, professional staging)
- Speaker travel: $150K (25 speakers × $6K average Dubai flights + hotel)
  - **Reality:** Dubai is not cheap. Budget $5K-$8K per international speaker.
- Marketing: $75K (need more than $50K for global event)
- Staff: $200K (underestimated - need 8 FTEs × 4 months + 30 temps)
- Swag and materials: $35K (quality materials for international audience)
- Insurance and legal: $25K (event liability, speaker contracts)
- Contingency (15%): $130K (10% is too low for first event in new location)
- **Total Expenses: $1,065K**

**Net Result: -$435K to -$535K** (loss, not surplus)
- **Reality:** Year 1 events typically lose money or break even
- **Mitigation:** Secure $500K grant specifically for Year 1 Summit, or reduce scope (300 attendees, not 500)

**Year 3 (1,200 attendees) Budget:**

**Revenue:**
- Registration: $900K (700 govt @ $600, 300 corporate @ $1,750, 100 students @ $250, 100 speakers free)
- Sponsorships: $1.2M (increased sponsor interest as community grows)
- **Total Revenue: $2.1M**

**Expenses:**
- Venue rental: $200K (larger venue)
- Catering: $400K (more attendees)
- AV and production: $150K (more elaborate production)
- Speaker travel: $200K (40 speakers)
- Marketing: $100K
- Staff: $300K
- Swag: $50K
- Contingency: $140K
- **Total Expenses: $1.54M**

**Net Surplus: $560K** (funds scholarships, research grants, platform development)

### 2.5 Summit Outputs and Impact

- **Contracts and Deals:** $50M+ in estimated contract value from connections made
- **Knowledge Applied:** 80% of attendees report applying learnings within 6 months
- **Certification Pipeline:** 20% of attendees enroll in certification programs post-summit
