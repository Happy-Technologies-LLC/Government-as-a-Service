## Integration with People Dimension

Process and People work as one integrated engine:

**PROCESS provides the METHOD:**
- ITIL defines HOW to operate services (incident, change, problem management)
- Agile defines HOW to deliver services (sprints, user stories, retrospectives)
- TBM defines HOW to measure value (cost allocation, service catalog)
- Zero Trust defines HOW to secure systems (verify everything, trust nothing)

**PEOPLE provide the CAPABILITY:**
- Service managers execute ITIL processes
- Scrum masters facilitate agile delivery
- Financial analysts perform TBM cost modeling
- Security engineers implement Zero Trust architecture

**TOGETHER they deliver:**
- Operational excellence (99.5%+ uptime)
- Rapid service delivery (2-week sprints)
- Cost transparency (know cost-per-service)
- Secure services (Zero Trust foundation)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Process Over People

**Symptom:** Rigid adherence to process without empowering people to adapt

**Solution:** Balance process rigor with team autonomy. ITIL and Agile are frameworks, not straitjackets.

### Pitfall 2: Boiling the Ocean

**Symptom:** Trying to implement all 10 playbooks simultaneously

**Solution:** Phased approach. Start with GSM foundation, add processes incrementally.

### Pitfall 3: Process Theater

**Symptom:** Documented processes that no one follows in practice

**Solution:** Make processes visible, measure compliance, embed in tools (not just documents).

### Pitfall 4: Technology Before Process

**Symptom:** Buying tools before defining processes

**Solution:** Define process first, then select tools that support it (not the other way around).

### Pitfall 5: One-Size-Fits-All

**Symptom:** Copy-pasting Estonia's X-Road or Singapore's Singpass process without adaptation

**Solution:** Adapt best practices to local context (culture, capacity, regulations).
