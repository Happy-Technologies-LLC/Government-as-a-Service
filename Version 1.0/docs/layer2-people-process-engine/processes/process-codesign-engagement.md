# Layer 2 Process: Co-Design & Citizen Engagement

**Official Operating Procedure**
**Layer 2: People & Process Engine → Process Dimension**

## PPT Investment Breakdown

This playbook follows the People-Process-Technology (PPT) framework with a strong emphasis on people and process, reflecting the human-centered nature of co-design.

**Investment Allocation:**
- **People (50%):** $1-2.5M - User researchers, designers, facilitators, citizen engagement specialists, accessibility experts
- **Process (40%):** $0.8-2M - Co-design methodology, research protocols, design standards, accessibility guidelines, feedback loops
- **Technology (10%):** $0.2-0.5M - Research tools, prototyping platforms, collaboration software, analytics

**Total Investment:** $2-5M annually

This allocation reflects that co-design is fundamentally about people and process, not technology. The majority of investment goes to skilled researchers and designers who can facilitate meaningful citizen engagement, with technology serving as an enabler rather than the focus.

---

## Executive Summary

This playbook provides comprehensive guidance for implementing user-centered co-design processes in government digital services, aligned with the Government as a Service (GaaS) framework. Co-design ensures services are built with citizens, not just for them.

**Key Objectives:**
- Establish systematic co-design methodology across government
- Engage 1,000+ citizens in service design within 12 months
- Map 10+ life-event journeys
- Achieve 4.5+/5.0 citizen satisfaction for co-designed services
- Build culture of user-centered design across government
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

**Expected Outcomes (What User Research ACTUALLY Delivers):**
- 30-40% reduction in service redesign cycles in Year 2 (Year 1 you're learning, slower)
- 65-75% first-time completion rate (80%+ is aspirational—some services are inherently complex)
- 25-35% reduction in support tickets (big wins come from fixing the TOP 3 pain points, not everything)
- Citizen satisfaction 4.0-4.3/5.0 vs. 3.2-3.5 for non-co-designed (meaningful but not miraculous)
- Foundation for continuous service improvement (yes, this is the real value—mindset shift)

**Timeline:** Ongoing (6-month setup takes 9-12 months in reality—hiring user researchers is HARD)
**Team Size:** 10-15 FTEs (you'll start with 4-5 and grow slowly because good researchers are expensive and scarce)

## Co-Design Methodology

### **Framework: UK GDS Service Standard (Adapted)**

**16 Service Standard Criteria:**

1. **Understand user needs** - Research with users, not assumptions
2. **Solve a whole problem** - Design around life events, not bureaucratic structures
3. **Provide joined-up experience** - Seamless across channels and agencies
4. **Make service simple to use** - Minimize cognitive load, intuitive design
5. **Make sure everyone can use service** - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
6. **Have a multidisciplinary team** - Diverse skills: design, research, development, content
7. **Use agile ways of working** - Iterate based on user feedback
8. **Iterate and improve frequently** - Launch early, improve continuously
9. **Create a secure service** - Security by design, build user trust
10. **Define what success looks like** - Measurable KPIs, track progress
11. **Choose the right tools and technology** - User needs drive tech choices, not reverse
12. **Make new source code open** - Default to open (with security exceptions)
13. **Use and contribute to open standards** - Interoperability, avoid lock-in
14. **Operate a reliable service** - 99.9%+ uptime, performance monitoring
15. **Test the service with minister** - Executive-level sign-off after testing
16. **Make service accessible** - WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, assistive technology support

**Governance:**
- All major services must pass Service Standard assessment before launch
- Independent assessment panel (include user research experts, accessibility specialists)
- Public reporting of assessment results (transparency)

---

### **2. Surveys**

**When to Use:** Quantify trends, reach large sample, validate hypotheses

**Sample Size:** 200-1,000+ respondents (depends on population size)

**Survey Design Best Practices:**
- **Short:** 10-15 questions (complete in 5-7 minutes)
- **Clear language:** Avoid jargon, use plain language
- **Mix question types:** Multiple choice, rating scales, open-ended
- **Test first:** Pilot with 10 people, refine before full launch

**Incentives:**
- Prize draw (10 x $100 gift cards)
- Or guaranteed small incentive ($5 gift card for completion)

---

### **3. Usability Testing**

**When to Use:** Test prototypes or live services, identify usability issues

**Sample Size:** 5-8 participants per test round (Nielsen Norman Group: 5 users find 85% of issues)

**Test Format:** Moderated, one-on-one, 60 minutes

**Setup:**
- Quiet room, laptop/phone with prototype
- Facilitator (asks questions, observes)
- Optional: Observer behind one-way glass or video feed
- Screen recording + audio recording

**Test Script:**

**1. Introduction (5 min)**
- Thank you, purpose, think-aloud protocol
- "We're testing the service, not you - no wrong answers"
- "Please say what you're thinking as you use it"

**2. Pre-Test Questions (5 min)**
- Have you used [service] before?
- What do you expect from this service?
- How would you normally do this task?

**3. Task Scenarios (40 min)**
- Give realistic scenarios, observe as user attempts
- **Example:** "You just started a new business. Use this website to register your business name."
- **Observe:**
  - Can they find where to start?
  - Do they understand labels and instructions?
  - Where do they hesitate or get stuck?
  - Do they complete the task successfully?
  - How long does it take?

- **Probing Questions (during task):**
  - "What are you looking for?"
  - "What do you think this means?"
  - "What would you do next?"
  - "Is this what you expected?"

**4. Post-Test Questions (10 min)**
- How was that experience?
- Rate difficulty (1-5: Very Difficult to Very Easy)
- What was most confusing?
- What would you change?
- Would you use this service? (Yes/No, why?)

**Analysis:**
- Note every issue (categorize: critical, major, minor)
- Calculate success rate (% who completed task)
- Calculate average time to complete
- Prioritize fixes (impact x frequency)
- Retest after fixes in next iteration

---

### **4. Field Observation (Contextual Inquiry)**

**When to Use:** Understand real-world context, uncover unstated needs

**Method:** Observe users in their natural environment (home, office, service center)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours per observation

**Approach:**
- Shadow user as they complete task (e.g., filling out form, calling help desk)
- Ask questions while observing: "Why did you do that?" "What are you thinking?"
- Note environment (interruptions, tools used, workarounds)
- Take photos (with permission)

**Insights:**
- Real-world constraints (poor lighting, slow internet, multitasking)
- Workarounds users have developed
- Help-seeking behavior (who do they ask? what resources do they use?)
- Emotional reactions in real-time

**Example:** Observing elderly citizen at home trying to access pension online
- Discovered: Small font size difficult to read, bifocals needed
- Discovered: Pop-up blocker prevented page load (thought service was down)
- Discovered: Asked grandson for help (learned service needs to be explainable to helper)

---

## Prototype Testing Procedures

### **Fidelity Levels**

**Low Fidelity (Paper Prototypes):**
- **When:** Early stage, testing concepts and flows
- **Tools:** Paper, markers, sticky notes
- **Pros:** Fast, cheap, easy to change
- **Cons:** Limited interactivity, doesn't feel "real"
- **Use Case:** Test information architecture, basic flow

**Medium Fidelity (Wireframes):**
- **When:** Mid-stage, testing layout and interaction patterns
- **Tools:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD (clickable prototypes)
- **Pros:** Looks more real, can test interactions, shareable
- **Cons:** Still not final design, development effort to make changes
- **Use Case:** Test task flows, page layouts, navigation

**High Fidelity (Functional Prototypes):**
- **When:** Late stage, testing final design and performance
- **Tools:** HTML/CSS/JS or native mobile code
- **Pros:** Looks and feels like final product, can test performance
- **Cons:** Expensive to change, may feel too "done" for users to critique
- **Use Case:** Pilot launch, final validation before full build

**Rule of Thumb:** Start low fidelity, increase as confidence grows.

---

### **A/B Testing**

**When to Use:** Choose between two design options, optimize based on data

**Method:** Randomly show version A or B to users, measure which performs better

**Example:**
- **Version A:** "Apply for Benefits" button (green, top right)
- **Version B:** "Check Eligibility First" button (blue, centered)
- **Metric:** Click-through rate, completion rate, time to complete

**Sample Size:** Need statistical significance (typically 100+ users per version)

**Duration:** Run until 95% confidence in result (usually 1-2 weeks)

**Analysis:**
- Calculate conversion rate for each version
- Use statistical test (chi-square or t-test) to determine if difference is significant
- Declare winner, implement for all users

**Best Practices:**
- Test one variable at a time (button color OR text, not both)
- Have clear hypothesis: "We believe Version B will increase completion rate by 10%"
- Don't stop test early (wait for statistical significance)
- Learn from losers too (why didn't it work?)

---

## Life-Event Journey Mapping

### **What is Life-Event Design?**

**Traditional Approach:** Services organized by government structure (departments, programs)
- Problem: Citizens don't think in terms of departments
- Example: "Where do I register a birth?" (Health? Civil Registry? Local government?)

**Life-Event Approach:** Services organized by citizen life events
- Solution: Start with life events, design seamless journeys
- Example: "Having a Baby" (includes birth registration, health checks, parental leave, child benefits - all bundled)

---

### **Journey Mapping Process**

**Example: "Having a Baby" Journey**

**Step 1: Research**
- Interview 20+ parents who recently had babies
- Survey 200+ parents
- Observe at hospitals, clinics, government service centers
- Map what they currently do (all touchpoints with government and other services)

**Step 2: Map Current State (As-Is Journey)**

```
STAGE 1: Prenatal
- Week 8: Notify employer (parental leave forms)
- Week 12: Register for prenatal classes (health dept website)
- Week 20: Apply for maternity benefits (social security office, in-person, 2-hour wait)
- Week 30: Research childcare options (multiple websites, confusing eligibility)

STAGE 2: Birth
- Day 0: Baby born at hospital
- Day 1: Hospital submits birth notification to health dept (paper form)
- Day 3: Parent visits civil registry to register birth (30 min drive, 1-hour wait)
- Day 5: Apply for birth certificate (separate process, fee, 2-week wait)

STAGE 3: First Year
- Week 1: Schedule newborn health check (call clinic, limited hours)
- Week 2: Apply for child benefits (online, but form asks for birth cert number - don't have yet)
- Week 4: Receive birth certificate (by mail)
- Week 6: Re-apply for child benefits (now have cert number)
- Month 2: Immunization (multiple appointments, manual record keeping)
- Month 6: Apply for childcare subsidy (different website, different login)
- Month 12: Update tax return to include dependent (manual entry of child details)
```

**Pain Points Identified:**
- 7 different government touchpoints, 5 different websites/offices
- Duplicate data entry (baby's name, DOB, parent info entered 7+ times)
- Waiting for birth certificate delays other applications
- In-person visits difficult with newborn
- Fragmented information (no single source of truth)
- Emotional stress (parents overwhelmed, sleep-deprived)

**Step 3: Design Future State (To-Be Journey)**

**Vision:** "One notification, everything done"

```
STAGE 1: Prenatal
- Week 8: Log into government portal (using digital ID)
- Week 8: Click "I'm Pregnant" - triggers life event workflow
- Week 8: System pre-fills forms with known data, asks for missing info (due date, hospital)
- Week 8: System suggests available services (parental leave, benefits, classes) - apply for all in one session
- Week 8: Confirmation and calendar (all appointments and deadlines)

STAGE 2: Birth
- Day 0: Baby born, hospital submits birth notification electronically (via API)
- Day 1: Parent receives notification on phone: "Congratulations! Next steps available."
- Day 1: Parent logs in, confirms baby details (name, time), approves birth registration
- Day 1: System auto-generates birth certificate (digital + mailed paper)
- Day 1: System auto-enrolls in child benefits (if eligible, based on income data)
- Day 1: System schedules newborn health check (user confirms preferred time)

STAGE 3: First Year
- Proactive notifications: "Immunization due next week - book now" (one click)
- Auto-updates: Tax record updated with dependent (no action needed)
- Childcare support: System surfaces subsidy application when parent searches childcare
- Unified health record: All immunizations logged automatically (via clinic API)
```

**Benefits:**
- 1 government touchpoint (portal/app) instead of 7
- Data entered once, reused (via APIs and "Tell Us Once")
- Birth certificate instant (digital) + mailed within 3 days
- Proactive nudges (notifications for upcoming needs)
- Reduced stress (parents can focus on baby, not paperwork)

**Estimated Impact:**
- Time saved: 10-15 hours per parent (vs. current state)
- Satisfaction: 4.5+/5.0 (vs. current 2.8/5.0)
- Benefit take-up: 95%+ (vs. current 60% - many don't know they're eligible)

---

### **Accessibility Testing Checklist**

**Automated Testing (Tools):**
- **WAVE (WebAIM):** Browser extension, identifies accessibility errors
- **Axe DevTools:** Browser extension, WCAG compliance checking
- **Lighthouse (Chrome):** Built-in audit tool, includes accessibility score

**Manual Testing:**

**1. Keyboard Navigation**
- [ ] Can you navigate entire site using only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Spacebar?
- [ ] Is focus indicator visible (outline around active element)?
- [ ] Logical tab order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)?
- [ ] No keyboard traps (can navigate back out of modals, menus)?

**2. Screen Reader Testing**
- [ ] Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac/iOS)
- [ ] All images have alt text (or marked decorative if no meaning)?
- [ ] Headings structured correctly (H1 → H2 → H3, not skipping levels)?
- [ ] Form labels associated with inputs (screen reader announces label)?
- [ ] Links descriptive ("Download tax form" not "Click here")?

**3. Visual Testing**
- [ ] Text contrast sufficient (use Contrast Checker tool)?
- [ ] Text resizable to 200% without loss of functionality?
- [ ] Color not used as only indicator (e.g., red for error + icon + text)?
- [ ] Works at 1280x1024 and 320x256 (zoom and mobile)?

**4. Forms & Errors**
- [ ] Error messages clear ("Email address missing" not "Error in field 3")?
- [ ] Error linked to field (screen reader can navigate to error source)?
- [ ] Suggestions provided ("Format: MM/DD/YYYY")?
- [ ] Success confirmation (after form submission)?

**5. Multimedia**
- [ ] Videos have captions?
- [ ] Audio descriptions for video content (if visual info critical)?
- [ ] Transcripts provided for audio content?

**6. Assistive Technology Compatibility**
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Test with voice control (Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Voice Control on iOS)
- [ ] Test with screen magnification (ZoomText, built-in OS zoom)

---

### **User Testing with People with Disabilities**

**Recruit Diverse Participants:**
- Visual impairments (blind, low vision, color blind)
- Hearing impairments (deaf, hard of hearing)
- Motor impairments (limited dexterity, use of assistive devices)
- Cognitive impairments (dyslexia, ADHD, autism)

**Sample Size:** 5+ participants with disabilities per round

**Adaptations:**
- Longer session time (90 min instead of 60)
- Provide breaks
- Flexible format (remote testing may be easier)
- Compensate fairly (higher incentive for specialized feedback)

**Observe:**
- Can they complete tasks independently?
- What assistive technology do they use (screen reader, switch control, etc.)?
- Where do they struggle?
- What workarounds have they developed?

**Learn & Fix:**
- Prioritize accessibility fixes (not "nice to have" - legal requirement)
- Retest after fixes
- Involve people with disabilities throughout design (not just testing at end)

## Case Studies & Templates

### **Case Study: UK Gov.uk**

**Context:**
- Consolidated 300+ government websites into one (www.gov.uk)
- User needs-driven design
- Plain language, mobile-first
- Continuous iteration based on data

**Approach:**
- Created Government Digital Service (GDS) - central team
- Established Service Standard (16 criteria)
- Embedded user researchers in every project team
- Published design patterns and style guide (open source)

**Research Methods Used:**
- 1,000+ hours of user research (interviews, usability testing) before launch
- Ongoing research: 20+ researchers, continuous testing
- Data-driven: A/B testing, analytics, user feedback

**Results:**
- User satisfaction: 80%+ (vs. 40% for old websites)
- Task completion rate: 85%+ (vs. 60%)
- Maintenance costs reduced by 50% (simpler design, less content)
- Awards: D&AD Black Pencil (highest design honor)

**Lessons:**
- Central team + design system = consistency at scale
- Service Standard as guardrail (prevents bad design from launching)
- "Start with user needs, not government structure" - cardinal rule
- Data + research beats opinions (make decisions based on evidence)

---

### **Case Study: Denmark Life Event Portal**

**Context:**
- Designed services around life events, not departments
- Example: "Having a Baby" bundles 12 services from 5 agencies

**Approach:**
- Mapped 20 major life events (from research with 500+ citizens)
- Redesigned services around these events
- "Tell Us Once" - share data across agencies
- Proactive notifications (reminders for upcoming needs)

**Example: Moving to New Address**
- Old way: Notify 8+ agencies separately (DMV, tax office, health, postal, etc.)
- New way: Update address once, system propagates to all agencies
- Result: 15 minutes vs. 3+ hours

**Results:**
- Digital service usage: 95%+ (vs. 60% pre-redesign)
- Citizen satisfaction: 4.6/5.0
- Time savings: 50M+ hours annually (across all life events)

**Lessons:**
- Life events resonate with citizens (intuitive mental model)
- Data sharing critical (APIs between agencies)
- Proactive > Reactive (nudge citizens before deadlines, don't wait for them to find service)

## Stakeholder Engagement Checklist: Who Needs to Buy In (And How)

Co-design sounds great in theory. In practice, you'll face resistance from 6 different stakeholder groups. Here's how to get them on board:

### 1. MINISTERS/POLITICAL LEADERSHIP (Make or Break)

**What they care about:**
- Political wins ("I delivered better services")
- Avoiding embarrassment (bad launch = media disaster)
- Budget defensibility (can they explain spending to parliament?)

**How to engage:**
- [ ] **Month 1:** Bring successful case study from another country (Estonia, UK) with THEIR political leader taking credit
- [ ] **Month 3:** Do a "minister testing day"—have them try the OLD service vs. the co-designed NEW service. Watch them struggle with the old one. They'll get it.
- [ ] **Quarterly:** One-page success metric dashboard (# citizens helped, satisfaction scores, media mentions). Politicians think in soundbites.

**Red flags:**
- Minister says "looks good" but doesn't defend budget in cabinet → you're dead, find new sponsor
- Minister wants to announce before it's ready → negotiate "soft launch" then official announcement
- New minister kills predecessor's project → this is why you need bi-partisan support early

---

### 2. PERMANENT SECRETARIES/SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS (Gatekeepers)

**What they care about:**
- Risk mitigation ("will this embarrass us?")
- Turf protection ("who controls this?")
- Legacy ("will this outlast me?")

**How to engage:**
- [ ] **Month 2:** Map the power structure. Who actually makes decisions? (Hint: not always the org chart)
- [ ] **Month 4:** Create "Service Standard Compliance" framework so they can mandate it (they love mandates)
- [ ] **Month 6:** Invite to international conference where they meet peers doing this (peer pressure works on bureaucrats)

**Red flags:**
- They delegate to junior staff → they don't care, escalate or find different sponsor
- They want "comprehensive report" before starting → analysis paralysis, push for "pilot first, report later"
- They say "we already do user research" (they mean one survey 3 years ago) → show them what REAL research looks like

---

### 3. FRONT-LINE STAFF (They'll Make or Break Adoption)

**What they care about:**
- "Will this make my job harder?"
- "Am I being replaced?"
- "Do I have to learn new things?" (honestly)

**How to engage:**
- [ ] **Month 1:** Include front-line staff in discovery research—they know where bodies are buried
- [ ] **Month 5:** Show them how NEW service reduces THEIR workload (fewer angry citizens calling)
- [ ] **Month 7:** Train them FIRST so they feel like experts, not victims of change

**Red flags:**
- They smile and nod in workshops but sabotage in implementation → find the informal leaders, win them first
- Union pushback on "job losses" → be honest: "This eliminates repetitive work, redeploys staff to complex cases" (true and defensible)
- "We've always done it this way" → this is cultural, not logical. Show metrics (old way: 40% satisfaction, new way: 75%)

---

### 4. IT/TECHNOLOGY TEAMS (Frenemies)

**What they care about:**
- "Is this more work for us?"
- "Do we control the tech stack?"
- "Will this break our systems?"

**How to engage:**
- [ ] **Month 2:** Involve tech lead in architecture decisions (don't surprise them)
- [ ] **Month 4:** Position as "make your life easier" (better APIs, less manual integration)
- [ ] **Month 8:** Celebrate technical wins publicly (CTO gets credit for platform, you get credit for UX)

**Red flags:**
- They say "can't be done technically" → usually means "we don't want to do it." Get second opinion.
- They build what they think is cool, not what users need → this is why you do user testing BEFORE dev
- They resist APIs/modular design → long-term disaster, escalate to CTO

---

### 5. BUDGET/FINANCE OFFICE (Money Gatekeepers)

**What they care about:**
- ROI (show me the money)
- Budget certainty (no surprises)
- Auditability (can we defend this spend?)

**How to engage:**
- [ ] **Month 1:** Build business case with ROI (use Estonia data: $100M invested, $1B saved over 10 years)
- [ ] **Quarterly:** Show "money saved" metrics (reduced call center costs, fewer in-person visits)
- [ ] **Annually:** Audit-ready documentation (where every dollar went, outcomes achieved)

**Red flags:**
- They ask for ROI in Year 1 → educate: investment years 1-2, returns year 3+
- They want to cut "soft costs" (user research, change management) → show them Healthcare.gov failure (saved $50M, wasted $1.7B)
- They freeze budget mid-project → have contingency fund or descope gracefully

---

### 6. CITIZENS/ADVOCACY GROUPS (Ultimate Customers)

**What they care about:**
- "Will this actually work for ME?"
- "Are you listening or just checking a box?"
- "What about [elderly/disabled/rural/marginalized group]?"

**How to engage:**
- [ ] **Month 1:** Recruit citizen advisory panel (12-15 people, paid, diverse)
- [ ] **Monthly:** Show them what you built based on their feedback ("you said X, we did Y")
- [ ] **Launch:** Invite them to launch event (they become ambassadors)

**Red flags:**
- You only talk to easy-to-reach citizens (urban, educated, online) → your service will exclude others
- Advocacy groups protest because you didn't consult → they're right, fix it by including them NOW
- Citizens participate once then ghost → you're not showing impact of their feedback, close the loop

---

## The 90-Day Stakeholder Engagement Blitz

Here's the order that actually works:

**Days 1-30: Political Air Cover**
1. Secure minister sponsor
2. Get cabinet/leadership approval for pilot
3. Brief opposition (yes, really—bipartisan support insulates you)

**Days 31-60: Bureaucratic Buy-In**
1. Permanent secretaries briefing (show international examples)
2. Create governance structure (steering committee with right people)
3. Secure multi-year budget commitment

**Days 61-90: Operational Alignment**
1. Front-line staff workshops (win hearts and minds)
2. IT architecture review (get technical buy-in)
3. Citizen advisory panel kickoff (show you mean it)

**If you skip this, you'll spend Year 2 fighting internal resistance instead of serving citizens.**

---

## What Co-Design Actually Costs (The Truth)

Playbook says $2-5M annually. Here's the real breakdown:

| Item | Playbook | Reality | Why the Difference |
|------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **User Researchers** (5 FTEs) | $500K | $750K | Good researchers command $150K+, not $100K |
| **Service Designers** (5 FTEs) | $500K | $700K | Design talent is expensive, competitive market |
| **Research Tools** (software) | $200K | $350K | You need video recording, transcription, analytics—adds up |
| **Participant Incentives** | $100K | $250K | $50-100 per person x 1,000 participants, plus travel for rural |
| **Workshops/Facilities** | $200K | $400K | Venue rental, catering, materials, travel for participants |
| **Accessibility Testing** | $150K | $300K | Specialized recruitment, assistive tech, longer sessions |
| **Training** (agency staff) | $350K | $500K | External trainers are expensive, need multiple rounds |
| **TOTAL** | **$2M** | **$3.25M** | |

**The gap:** 60% more than "planned." This is normal. Budget for it.

---

## Your Final Reality Check

Co-design will NOT:
- Make everyone happy (some citizens will still complain)
- Guarantee political success (bad comms can kill good UX)
- Eliminate all service redesign (you'll still iterate)
- Work overnight (culture change takes 2-3 years)

Co-design WILL:
- Reduce catastrophic failures (you test before launch, not after)
- Build services people actually use (vs. build and pray)
- Create internal champions (staff who see citizen impact become believers)
- Compound over time (each co-designed service makes the next easier)

**The Question:** Are you ready to actually LISTEN to citizens and act on what they say, even if it contradicts your assumptions?

If yes → start recruiting your team.
If no → don't bother with co-design, you'll just waste everyone's time.
