## PPT Investment Breakdown

This playbook follows the People-Process-Technology (PPT) framework with dominant emphasis on people, reflecting the human-centered nature of change management.

**Investment Allocation:**
- **People (70%):** Change managers, trainers, champions network, communications specialists, organizational development
- **Process (20%):** Change methodologies, training curricula, communication plans, stakeholder engagement procedures
- **Technology (10%):** Learning management systems, collaboration tools, survey platforms, analytics

**Total Investment:** $150K-$5M (varies by organization size - typically 5-10% of digital transformation budget)

This allocation reflects that change management is fundamentally about people - understanding resistance, building skills, fostering culture change, and enabling adoption. Technology serves primarily as an enabler for training delivery and communication.

## GSM Framework Alignment

This playbook aligns with the **Government Service Management (GSM)** framework, specifically:
- **GSM Organizational Change Management Practice** - Government-specific change enablement and stakeholder engagement
- **GSM Workforce and Talent Management** - Skills development and capacity building for digital government
- **GSM Relationship Management** - Citizen and stakeholder engagement aligned with public value
- **GSM Continual Improvement** - Learning culture and continuous service enhancement

GSM replaces traditional change management frameworks with government-focused approaches emphasizing democratic participation, public service values, and whole-of-government collaboration.

## 6. Resistance Management

### 6.1 Common Resistance Patterns

#### **Pattern 1: Fear of Job Loss**

**Manifestation**:
- "Automation will replace us"
- "Why invest in training if I won't have a job?"
- Anxiety, low morale, spreading negativity

**Root Causes**:
- Previous layoffs or restructuring
- Media stories about AI/automation replacing workers
- Lack of clarity on future staffing plans

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Transparent Communication** (from executives)
   - Clear statement: "No layoffs planned due to this initiative"
   - Explanation: "Automation handles repetitive tasks; staff focus on complex, meaningful work"
   - Commitment: Put it in writing, communicate repeatedly

2. **Upskilling and Reskilling**
   - Offer training in new skills (data analysis, customer service excellence)
   - Create career paths: "Your role is evolving, here's how to grow"
   - Highlight examples: "Staff member X moved from data entry to process improvement analyst"

3. **Attrition and Redeployment**
   - If efficiencies do reduce need for staff, manage through attrition (don't backfill retirements)
   - Redeploy staff to higher-value work (e.g., proactive outreach, citizen engagement)

4. **Union Engagement** (if applicable)
   - Involve union early in planning
   - Negotiate commitments: Job security, training, redeployment
   - Collaborative approach: "We're in this together"

---

#### **Pattern 2: Skepticism About Benefits**

**Manifestation**:
- "We've tried this before and it failed"
- "This is just the latest buzzword"
- "It won't actually make our jobs easier"

**Root Causes**:
- History of failed IT projects
- Over-promises and under-delivery
- Lack of trust in leadership

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Acknowledge the Past**
   - "We know previous initiatives didn't deliver. Here's what we're doing differently"
   - Admit mistakes, show lessons learned
   - Build credibility through honesty

2. **Demonstrate Quick Wins**
   - Pilot program: Let skeptics see results firsthand
   - Success stories: Share tangible examples from other organizations
   - Show, don't just tell: Live demonstrations, not PowerPoint

3. **Involve Skeptics**
   - Invite them to pilot program: "Try it and give us honest feedback"
   - Co-create solutions: "Help us design this so it actually works"
   - Convert critics to champions: Once they see it works, they become advocates

4. **Realistic Expectations**
   - Don't overpromise: "This won't solve every problem, but it will improve X, Y, Z"
   - Be honest about challenges: "Implementation will be bumpy; here's how we'll handle issues"
   - Incremental benefits: "We'll see improvements over time, not overnight"

#### **Pattern 3: Workload and Time Concerns**

**Manifestation**:
- "I don't have time for training"
- "This will just add to my workload"
- "I'm too busy with my real job to learn a new system"

**Root Causes**:
- Already overworked staff
- Training scheduled during peak work periods
- Lack of backfill or coverage

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Backfill and Coverage**
   - Hire temporary staff or reassign work during training
   - Reduce workload expectations: "You're not expected to maintain full productivity while in training"
   - Manager communication: "Your priority this week is training"

2. **Flexible Training Schedule**
   - Offer multiple session times (morning, afternoon, evening)
   - Self-paced e-learning (complete on your schedule)
   - Just-in-time training (close to go-live, not months in advance)

3. **Paid Training Time**
   - Training during work hours (not personal time)
   - Overtime pay if training is outside normal hours
   - Manager support: "This is part of your job, not extra"

4. **Workload Relief Post-Launch**
   - "Yes, it's extra work now, but once you're trained, the new system will save you 5-10 hours/week"
   - Demonstrate time savings: "You currently spend 2 hours/day on X; new system does it in 15 minutes"
   - Long-term benefit: "Short-term investment for long-term gain"

---

#### **Pattern 4: Technical Anxiety**

**Manifestation**:
- "I'm not tech-savvy"
- "What if I break something?"
- "I'll never learn this"

**Root Causes**:
- Low computer literacy (especially older staff)
- Fear of looking incompetent
- Previous negative experiences with technology

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Beginner-Friendly Training**
   - No assumptions: Start with basics (how to log in, use a mouse)
   - Patient instructors: Allow extra time, encourage questions
   - Small class sizes: 8-12 people max for hands-on attention

2. **Practice Environment**
   - Safe sandbox: "You can't break anything here; practice as much as you want"
   - Unlimited access: Practice at your own pace, outside of training
   - Remediation: Extra training sessions for those who need more time

3. **Buddy System**
   - Pair tech-anxious staff with tech-savvy peers
   - Peer mentoring: "Your buddy is here to help anytime you need"
   - Champions as tutors: Designated staff to answer questions

4. **Positive Reinforcement**
   - Celebrate small wins: "You successfully completed your first task!"
   - Build confidence incrementally: Start easy, gradually increase complexity
   - Normalize mistakes: "Everyone makes mistakes while learning; that's how we improve"

---

### 6.2 Root Cause Analysis

**Use the "5 Whys" technique to uncover root causes**:

**Example**:

**Presenting Issue**: "Staff aren't completing training"

1. **Why?** "They say they don't have time"
   2. **Why?** "They're too busy with their regular work"
      3. **Why?** "No one is covering their work while they're in training"
         4. **Why?** "Managers didn't budget for coverage"
            5. **Why?** "Training workload wasn't communicated clearly to managers"

**Root Cause**: Lack of manager communication and planning for training coverage

**Solution**:
- Send detailed communication to managers 6 weeks before training
- Provide budget for temporary coverage
- Reduce workload expectations during training period
- Hold managers accountable for staff completion rates

---

### 6.3 Escalation Procedures

**Level 1: Peer Intervention** (for mild resistance)
- Champions or peers have informal conversations
- Share success stories, answer questions
- Encourage participation

**Level 2: Manager Intervention** (for moderate resistance)
- Manager has one-on-one conversation
- Understand concerns, address root causes
- Set clear expectations for participation
- Follow up regularly

**Level 3: Change Manager Intervention** (for significant resistance)
- Change manager investigates root causes
- Tailored support plan (extra training, resources, mentoring)
- Regular check-ins and coaching
- Document progress

**Level 4: Executive Intervention** (for persistent resistance)
- Executive sponsor meets with resistor
- Reinforce strategic importance
- Offer final support and resources
- Set consequences for non-compliance

**Level 5: HR Disciplinary Action** (for disruptive resistance)
- Formal performance improvement plan
- Written warning
- Potential reassignment or termination (last resort)
- Document all actions for legal protection

**When to Escalate**:
- Level 1→2: After 2 weeks of gentle encouragement
- Level 2→3: After 2 manager conversations with no progress
- Level 3→4: If resistance is affecting team or project
- Level 4→5: If resistance is insubordination or disruptive

---

### 6.4 Success Stories to Counter Resistance

**Strategy**: Share real examples of successful transformations to build confidence

#### **Case Study 1: City of Boston**

**Context**: Implemented 311 digital service request system

**Initial Resistance**:
- Front-line staff feared job loss
- Skepticism about citizen adoption
- Concerns about system reliability

**How They Overcame**:
- **Job Security**: Mayor publicly committed to no layoffs; instead, staff focused on complex cases
- **Pilot Program**: Started with 2 departments, showed 60% increase in request volume (more work, not less)
- **Quick Wins**: Within 3 months, resolution time dropped 40%, citizen satisfaction up 25%

**Outcome**:
- 95% staff adoption within 6 months
- Staff reported feeling more productive and less stressed
- Many initial resistors became champions

**Lesson**: "Pilot programs and quick wins convert skeptics"

---

#### **Case Study 2: State of Utah**

**Context**: Modernized unemployment insurance system

**Initial Resistance**:
- Caseworkers (average age 55) anxious about learning new technology
- Union concerns about workload increase
- Fear that online services would overwhelm staff

**How They Overcame**:
- **Tailored Training**: Extra sessions for tech-anxious staff, buddy system, unlimited practice time
- **Union Partnership**: Involved union in design, guaranteed no layoffs, created career paths for upskilling
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased over 18 months (not "big bang"), allowed staff to adjust

**Outcome**:
- 98% staff completion of training
- Staff survey: 82% felt prepared, 75% felt the new system was easier
- Caseworkers now handle 30% more claims with same headcount (but less repetitive work)

**Lesson**: "Meet people where they are; provide extra support for those who need it"

---

#### **Case Study 3: County of San Diego**

**Context**: Unified permit and licensing platform

**Initial Resistance**:
- 12 different departments with unique processes; "our work is different" mindset
- Territorial department heads worried about losing control
- Front-line staff overwhelmed by change volume

**How They Overcame**:
- **Co-Creation**: Involved department heads and front-line staff in design; customized workflows for each department
- **Champions Network**: Recruited 50 champions across all departments; met monthly to share learnings
- **Change Fatigue Management**: Bundled all changes into one initiative (instead of 12 separate projects)

**Outcome**:
- All 12 departments live within 12 months
- Inter-department collaboration improved (data sharing, joint processing)
- Staff reported feeling heard and valued; 80% satisfaction with change process

**Lesson**: "Involve people in the solution; they'll own the outcome"

### 9.3 Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **In-House Content Development** (save 30-50%)
   - Train internal staff to use authoring tools (Articulate, Captivate)
   - Develop simple videos and guides in-house
   - Outsource only complex content

2. **Open-Source LMS** (save 50-80%)
   - Use Moodle (free) instead of commercial LMS
   - Hosting and support still required ($5K-15K/year)

3. **Peer Training** (save 20-40% on instructor costs)
   - Train-the-trainer: Upskill internal staff to deliver training
   - Champions as co-trainers
   - Reduces need for external trainers

4. **Virtual Training** (save 30-50% on logistics)
   - Conduct training via Zoom/Teams instead of in-person
   - Eliminates facility rental, catering, travel costs
   - Trade-off: Less hands-on, lower engagement

5. **Leverage Vendor Resources** (free)
   - Many software vendors provide free training materials, webinars, certifications
   - Customize vendor content instead of building from scratch

6. **Phased Rollout** (spread costs over time)
   - Train departments incrementally (not all at once)
   - Spreads budget over 12-18 months instead of 3-6 months
   - Allows learning from early phases to improve later phases

**Potential Savings**: 20-40% of total budget with strategic cost-saving measures

   - Estimated savings: $50K - $500K/year (vs. poorly trained staff)

2. **Faster Time to Proficiency**
   - Staff productive within 2-4 weeks (vs. 3-6 months without training)
   - Estimated value: $100K - $1M (lost productivity avoided)

3. **Lower Error Rates**
   - Trained staff make 50-70% fewer errors
   - Estimated savings: $50K - $300K/year (rework, customer service, reputation)

4. **Higher Employee Retention**
   - Good training and change management reduces turnover by 10-20%
   - Estimated savings: $100K - $1M/year (recruitment, onboarding costs)

## Change Resistance Scenarios and Responses (What WILL Happen)

You're about to face resistance. It's not "if," it's "when" and "how much." Here are the 8 most common resistance patterns we see, with proven responses.

### Scenario 1: "This Is Just Another Flavor of the Month"

**What they say:** "We've seen 5 'transformations' in 10 years. This will fail like the others."

**Why it happens:** They've been burned before. Previous initiatives launched with fanfare, then quietly died when leadership moved on.

**Wrong response:** "This time it's different!" (They've heard this before.)

**Right response:**
1. **Acknowledge the pattern:** "You're right. Government has a bad track record with these. Let me show you how this is different."
2. **Show commitment mechanisms:**
   - Budget locked for 3 years (not annual renewal)
   - Written in ministerial performance agreements
   - Independent governance council (not just internal)
   - Bi-partisan support (survives government changes)
3. **Start small, prove value:** "We're not asking you to believe. We're asking you to watch the pilot. If it fails, we kill it."

**Success indicator:** When skeptics say "okay, I'll give it a chance" instead of "I'll wait for it to blow over."

---

### Scenario 2: "You're Replacing Us With Robots"

**What they say:** "Digital services mean fewer staff. You're making me redundant."

**Why it happens:** Automation DOES eliminate some tasks. Their fear is rational.

**Wrong response:** "No one's losing their job!" (Might not be true, and they won't believe you anyway.)

**Right response:**
1. **Be honest about task changes:** "Yes, we're automating data entry. That's 30% of your current work. Let's talk about the other 70%."
2. **Show the better work:**
   - "Instead of data entry, you'll handle complex cases that require judgment."
   - "Instead of repetitive calls, you'll solve the problems automation can't."
   - "We're redeploying, not firing. Your expertise is valuable elsewhere."
3. **Offer first choice:** "Champions get first pick of new roles. Resistors get whatever's left."

**Success indicator:** When staff see automation as "freeing me from boring work" instead of "taking my job."

---

### Scenario 3: "Our Citizens Are Not Ready For This"

**What they say:** "Our population is elderly/rural/low literacy. Digital won't work here."

**Why it happens:** Often genuine concern, sometimes projection of their own tech anxiety.

**Wrong response:** "Everyone uses smartphones now!" (Not true, and dismissive of real barriers.)

**Right response:**
1. **Validate the concern:** "You're right. 20-30% of our population has limited digital access. That's why we're NOT going digital-only."
2. **Show multi-channel strategy:**
   - Digital for those who prefer it (60-70%)
   - Assisted digital (help desk, service centers) for those who need support (20-30%)
   - Phone and in-person for those who can't/won't use digital (10-15%)
3. **Involve them in solutions:** "You know these citizens best. Help us design the assisted digital services."

**Success indicator:** When they shift from "citizens can't do this" to "let me help design the support systems."

---

### Scenario 4: "I'm Too Old to Learn New Systems"

**What they say:** (Usually unspoken) "I'm 3 years from retirement. Why bother?"

**Why it happens:** Learning anxiety + cost-benefit calculation (low benefit if retiring soon).

**Wrong response:** "It's easy, anyone can learn!" (Patronizing and untrue.)

**Right response:**
1. **Acknowledge the calculation:** "Fair point. You've got 3 years left. Let's make those 3 years easier, not harder."
2. **Show immediate payoff:**
   - "New system saves you 2 hours/day on reporting. That's 500 hours/year you get back."
   - "Less manual work = less back pain/eye strain/stress."
3. **Offer tailored support:**
   - Buddy system (pair with tech-comfortable colleague)
   - Slower-paced training (half the group, double the time)
   - Job aids at their desk (laminated quick reference)
4. **Respect contributions:** "You have 25 years of institutional knowledge. We need you to stay effective, not struggle."

**Success indicator:** When near-retirees become champions because "this actually makes my life easier."

---

### Scenario 5: "The Union Will Fight This"

**What they say:** "Labor agreements don't allow job changes without negotiation."

**Why it happens:** Legitimate union power + union leaders protecting turf.

**Wrong response:** "This doesn't affect job classifications." (Yes it does, and union knows it.)

**Right response:**
1. **Engage union EARLY (Month 1, not Month 11):**
   - Present as partnership, not mandate
   - "We want your input on protecting workers during transition."
2. **Offer union wins:**
   - Retraining budget (union-approved providers)
   - No involuntary layoffs clause
   - Automation creates NEW roles (define them with union)
3. **Make union part of governance:**
   - Union rep on steering committee
   - Quarterly labor-management transformation updates
4. **Communicate wins TO members:** Help union leadership look good to their members.

**Success indicator:** Union president says "we shaped this transformation to protect our members" instead of "we're fighting management's plan."

---

### Scenario 6: "We Don't Have Time For Training"

**What they say:** "We're already understaffed. Can't take people offline for 2 days."

**Why it happens:** True capacity constraints + training seen as optional distraction.

**Wrong response:** "Training is mandatory, find time." (Creates resentment, rushed training, poor learning.)

**Right response:**
1. **Acknowledge capacity reality:** "You're right, we're asking for 100 hours of staff time in Month 11. That's real cost."
2. **Build training into capacity plan:**
   - Hire temps to backfill (budget for it)
   - Reduce service hours during training week (communicate to citizens)
   - Stagger training (half team Week 1, half team Week 2)
3. **Make training ROI visible:**
   - "2 days training now = 30 days saved over next year from efficiency gains."
   - "Undertrained staff = 6 months of high error rates and support tickets."
4. **Offer just-in-time micro-learning:** "Can't do 2-day workshop? Here's 8 x 15-minute modules you can fit into your day."

**Success indicator:** When managers proactively schedule training time instead of resisting it.

---

### Scenario 7: "Our Executive Sponsor Just Left"

**What they say:** "The new minister/director doesn't care about this project."

**Why it happens:** Government leadership turnover is normal (avg. 18 months).

**Wrong response:** "The project continues regardless." (Not true—executive support determines budget and priority.)

**Right response:**
1. **Have succession plan in place:**
   - Identify 2-3 potential new sponsors BEFORE current one leaves
   - Document wins in sponsor-neutral language (outcomes, not personalities)
2. **Rapid re-onboarding:**
   - Brief new exec within first 30 days (not 90)
   - Frame as THEIR opportunity (don't dwell on predecessor)
   - Show quick wins: "Here's what we've achieved. Here's what you can claim credit for in 6 months."
3. **Activate political network:**
   - If minister changes, engage permanent secretary
   - If CEO changes, engage board chair
   - Someone senior must believe in this
4. **Build institutional resilience:**
   - Move project from "executive passion project" to "institutional commitment"
   - Embed in budget cycles, governance, performance metrics

**Success indicator:** New exec says "I'm continuing this momentum" instead of "I'm launching a strategic review."

---

### Scenario 8: "The Old System Still Works Fine"

**What they say:** "Why change something that isn't broken?"

**Why it happens:** Status quo bias + hidden costs of current system not visible to them.

**Wrong response:** "The old system is terrible!" (Attacks their identity—they built/maintained it.)

**Right response:**
1. **Honor the past:** "The old system served us well for 15 years. It was right for that era."
2. **Show the invisible costs:**
   - "Citizens wait 2 weeks for service (they don't complain, but they're frustrated)."
   - "We spend $200K/year on manual workarounds (you don't see it, it's in IT budget)."
   - "Staff turnover in this dept is 25% (exit interviews cite 'frustrating systems')."
3. **Make new system THEIR idea:**
   - "What would you change if you could rebuild from scratch?"
   - Capture their ideas, incorporate into new design
   - Credit them in launch: "Built with input from our front-line experts"
4. **Offer long transition:** "Old and new systems run in parallel for 6 months. You decide when to switch."

**Success indicator:** When defenders of old system become designers of new system.

---

## The Resistance Reality Check

Here's what the playbook won't tell you:

**You will NOT get:**
- 95% training completion by go-live (you'll get 75-80%)
- 4.0/5.0 satisfaction (you'll get 3.5-3.8 in first 6 months, 4.0+ by Month 12)
- 80% system adoption in Month 3 (you'll get 50-60%, reaching 80% by Month 8-10)

**You WILL get:**
- 10-15% hardcore resistors who never adopt (plan workarounds)
- 3-month productivity dip post-launch (people learning, making mistakes)
- 50% more support tickets in Months 1-3 (people struggling, then learning)
- Vocal minority making noise (while silent majority quietly adopts)

**Your Job:**
- Manage the 70% persuadables (don't waste energy on hardcore resistors)
- Celebrate early wins loudly (momentum is contagious)
- Respond to resistance with empathy, not mandates
- Give people time (behavior change takes 6-12 months, not 6 weeks)

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**

Change management is NOT about making everyone happy. It's about getting enough people on board to reach critical mass (60-70%), after which social proof takes over and the rest follow.

Some people will never adopt. That's okay. Design around them, don't fight them.
