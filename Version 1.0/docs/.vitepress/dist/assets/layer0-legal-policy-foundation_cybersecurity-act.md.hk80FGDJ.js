id="purpose-of-this-legislative-template" tabindex="-1">Purpose of This Legislative Template <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose-of-this-legislative-template" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Purpose of This Legislative Template&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This Cybersecurity Act provides a comprehensive legal framework for protecting critical infrastructure, government systems, and digital economy from cyber threats. It establishes:</p><ul><li><strong>National coordination</strong>: Central authority and strategy</li><li><strong>Risk-based regulation</strong>: Proportionate to criticality and threat</li><li><strong>Incident response</strong>: Coordinated national capability</li><li><strong>Public-private collaboration</strong>: Shared responsibility and information sharing</li><li><strong>International cooperation</strong>: Cross-border threat response</li></ul><p>The Act is modeled on best practices from:</p><ul><li><strong>Singapore</strong>: Cybersecurity Act 2018</li><li><strong>European Union</strong>: NIS Directive and NIS2 Directive</li><li><strong>United States</strong>: Cybersecurity Act, CISA, sector-specific regulations</li><li><strong>Australia</strong>: Security of Critical Infrastructure Act</li><li><strong>United Kingdom</strong>: Network and Information Systems Regulations</li></ul><h3 id="key-design-choices" tabindex="-1">Key Design Choices <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-design-choices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Design Choices&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>1. Critical Infrastructure Focus</strong></p><p>The Act prioritizes CII—systems essential to society and economy. This concentrates resources where disruption would cause greatest harm while avoiding over-regulation of low-risk entities.</p><p><strong>Adaptation Note</strong>: CII designation criteria should reflect national context (threats, dependencies, redundancies).</p><p><strong>2. Risk-Based Approach</strong></p><p>Requirements scale with risk:</p><ul><li><strong>CII</strong>: Highest obligations (continuous monitoring, SOC, audits, reporting)</li><li><strong>ESPs</strong>: Moderate obligations (standards compliance, incident reporting)</li><li><strong>Other entities</strong>: Voluntary best practices, encouraged participation</li></ul><p>This balances security with avoiding excessive compliance burden.</p><p><strong>3. Incident Reporting Mandate</strong></p><p>Mandatory incident reporting creates national situational awareness and enables coordinated response. Timeliness requirements reflect incident severity.</p><p>Safe harbor for good-faith reporting encourages transparency without fear of punishment.</p><p><strong>4. Information Sharing</strong></p><p>Cyber threats are information problems—sharing intelligence multiplies defensive capability. Voluntary participation mechanisms (confidentiality, safe harbor, reciprocal benefits) incentivize sharing.</p><p><strong>5. Coordinated National Response</strong></p><p>National CIRT provides capability beyond what individual entities can afford. Government investment in shared infrastructure (GSOC, threat intelligence, forensics) levels playing field.</p><p><strong>6. Criminal Penalties</strong></p><p>Strong criminal penalties deter cybercrime and support international law enforcement cooperation. Extraterritorial jurisdiction reflects borderless nature of cyber threats.</p><p><strong>7. International Cooperation</strong></p><p>Cyber threats don&#39;t respect borders. International cooperation on threat intelligence, incident response, and law enforcement is essential. Alignment with international standards facilitates cooperation.</p><h3 id="relationship-to-other-laws" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Other Laws <a class="header-anchor"
