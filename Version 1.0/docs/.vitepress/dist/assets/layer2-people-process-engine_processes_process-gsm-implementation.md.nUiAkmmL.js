Be brutally honest.</p><p><strong>Question 1: The Budget Question</strong> Last year, what % of your digital transformation budget went to:</p><ul><li>[ ] A) 70%+ technology, &lt;30% people+process → <strong>You&#39;re in the Technology Trap</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) 50-60% technology, 40-50% people+process → <strong>You&#39;re Rebalancing</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) 40-40-20 PPT balance (±10%) → <strong>You&#39;ve Achieved Balance</strong> (Level 3)</li><li>[ ] D) I have no idea, we don&#39;t track this → <strong>You&#39;re Pre-Level 1</strong> (Start Here)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 2: The Governance Question</strong> When you need to approve a $2M project, what happens?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) Email approval from CIO, takes 2 days → <strong>No Real Governance</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) Steering committee meeting, takes 2-4 weeks, sometimes contentious → <strong>Governance Exists But Immature</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) Structured review by dimensional councils, PPT analysis, decision in 3 weeks with documentation → <strong>Mature Governance</strong> (Level 3)</li><li>[ ] D) Endless meetings, no decision for 3 months, project dies → <strong>Governance Theater</strong> (Dysfunctional)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 3: The People Question</strong> Your IT team needs to learn cloud architecture. What happens?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) &quot;Google it&quot; or &quot;ask the vendor&quot; → <strong>No Investment in People</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) Annual training budget ($1K/person), optional conference attendance → <strong>Minimal People Investment</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) Structured capability development, $3K+/person, mandatory certifications, career paths → <strong>Strategic People Investment</strong> (Level 3)</li><li>[ ] D) Training? We just hire consultants → <strong>Permanent Consulting Dependency</strong> (Unsustainable)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 4: The Process Question</strong> When a critical system goes down, what happens?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) Chaos—everyone pings IT, no clear process, fix happens but takes 4-8 hours → <strong>Firefighting Mode</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) Incident logged, basic triage, usually fixed in 2-4 hours, postmortem sometimes happens → <strong>Basic Process</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) P1 incident process kicks in, escalation automatic, fix in &lt;1 hour, mandatory postmortem with action items tracked → <strong>Mature ITSM</strong> (Level 3)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 5: The Measurement Question</strong> Do you know your current service availability % for top 5 services?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) No, we don&#39;t measure → <strong>Level 1</strong></li><li>[ ] B) Yes, but data is manually compiled monthly → <strong>Level 2</strong></li><li>[ ] C) Yes, real-time dashboard, automated alerting, SLA tracking → <strong>Level 3</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Question 6: The Integration Question</strong> How many point-to-point integrations do you have vs. API-based?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) 90%+ point-to-point (spaghetti architecture) → <strong>Level 1</strong></li><li>[ ] B) 50-70% point-to-point, moving to APIs → <strong>Level 2</strong></li><li>[ ] C) 70%+ API-based, governed through API gateway → <strong>Level 3</strong></li><li>[ ] D) We don&#39;t know what we have → <strong>Technical Debt Nightmare</strong> (Pre-Level 1)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 7: The Culture Question</strong> When you propose a new idea, what&#39;s the typical response?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) &quot;That&#39;ll never work here&quot; / &quot;We tried that before&quot; → <strong>Culture of No</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) &quot;Interesting, show me a business case&quot; → <strong>Risk-Averse But Open</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) &quot;Let&#39;s pilot it and see&quot; → <strong>Innovation Culture</strong> (Level 3)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 8: The Failure Question</strong> Last digital project that failed—what happened?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) Blamed vendor, moved on, no lessons learned → <strong>Level 1</strong></li><li>[ ] B) Postmortem happened, some lessons documented, little changed → <strong>Level 2</strong></li><li>[ ] C) Root cause analysis, process changes, lessons embedded in governance → <strong>Level 3</strong></li><li>[ ] D) We don&#39;t talk about failures → <strong>Toxic Culture</strong> (Serious Problem)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 9: The Stakeholder Question</strong> Who attends your digital governance meetings?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) Just IT people → <strong>Tech-Centric</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) IT + a few business representatives → <strong>Partial Stakeholder Engagement</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) CDO, CHRO, COO, CTO, CFO + service owners (balanced representation) → <strong>Strategic Governance</strong> (Level 3)</li></ul><p><strong>Question 10: The Political Question</strong> (The Honest One) If your minister/mayor/elected leader changes tomorrow, what happens to your digital transformation?</p><ul><li>[ ] A) New leader kills it, we start over → <strong>Politically Fragile</strong> (Level 1)</li><li>[ ] B) New leader &quot;reviews&quot; it, we lose 6 months, might survive → <strong>Politically Vulnerable</strong> (Level 2)</li><li>[ ] C) Embedded in governance/legislation, survives leadership changes → <strong>Institutionalized</strong> (Level 3)</li></ul><hr><h3 id="scoring-your-maturity" tabindex="-1">Scoring Your Maturity <a class="header-anchor" href="#scoring-your-maturity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scoring Your Maturity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Count your answers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mostly A&#39;s or D&#39;s:</strong> You&#39;re at <strong>Level 1 (Initial/Chaotic)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reality:</strong> You&#39;re not ready for GSM.

Your procurement office loves single vendors (one contract, one relationship, one blame target).</p><p><strong>They&#39;ll say:</strong> &quot;Multi-vendor is 3x more paperwork. Can&#39;t you just use one big systems integrator?&quot;</p><p><strong>What&#39;s really happening:</strong> They&#39;re optimizing for THEIR workload, not your outcomes.</p><p><strong>Your response:</strong></p><ol><li>Don&#39;t fight them—empathize: &quot;I get it, this is more work for you.&quot;</li><li>Offer staffing help: &quot;What if we add 1 FTE to procurement to manage this?&quot; (budget for it)</li><li>Show risk: &quot;Vendor lock-in means if they fail, we&#39;re screwed. Multiple vendors = insurance.&quot;</li><li>Compromise: &quot;Let&#39;s do 2-3 vendors, not 10. That&#39;s manageable.&quot;</li></ol><p><strong>Win condition:</strong> They begrudgingly agree because you&#39;ve addressed their workload AND shown risk.</p><hr><h3 id="political-reality-2-your-cfo-will-try-to-cut-soft-costs" tabindex="-1">Political Reality #2: Your CFO Will Try to Cut &quot;Soft Costs&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#political-reality-2-your-cfo-will-try-to-cut-soft-costs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Political Reality #2: Your CFO Will Try to Cut &quot;Soft Costs&quot;&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>The Setup:</strong> Year 1 budget review. CFO sees:</p><ul><li>Technology: $8M (servers, software, looks tangible)</li><li>People: $16M (training, change management)</li><li>Process: $16M (consulting, governance)</li></ul><p><strong>CFO&#39;s instinct:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s cut the &#39;soft stuff,&#39; focus on technology.&quot;</p><p><strong>Why this is disaster:</strong> Technology without people/process = $8M wasted.</p><p><strong>Your defense:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Show failures:</strong> Pull up Healthcare.gov ($1.7B wasted, tech-first approach).</li><li><strong>Show successes:</strong> Estonia ($200M invested balanced, $10B saved over 20 years).</li><li><strong>Offer trade:</strong> &quot;Cut people/process by 10%, but I need 20% contingency for tech overruns.&quot; (They&#39;ll take the trade.)</li><li><strong>Make CFO co-accountable:</strong> &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll cut training. When adoption fails and we have to redo this in 2 years for $30M, whose budget does that come from?&quot;</li></ol><p><strong>Win condition:</strong> They approve 40-40-20, but you give up something else (office space, headcount elsewhere) as trade.</p><hr><h3 id="political-reality-3-your-minister-wants-announcements-you-need-time" tabindex="-1">Political Reality #3: Your Minister Wants Announcements, You Need Time <a class="header-anchor" href="#political-reality-3-your-minister-wants-announcements-you-need-time" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Political Reality #3: Your Minister Wants Announcements, You Need Time&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>The Conflict:</strong></p><ul><li>Minister: &quot;I want to announce this at the party conference in 3 months.&quot;</li><li>You: &quot;We&#39;re 6 months away from being ready.&quot;</li></ul><p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Politicians optimize for media cycles. You optimize for service quality.</p><p><strong>Wrong response:</strong> &quot;Minister, we need more time.&quot; (You lose, they announce anyway, you&#39;re screwed.)</p><p><strong>Right response:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Give them SOMETHING to announce:</strong> &quot;How about we announce the PILOT in 3 months? Small scale, manageable. If it works, you get to announce scale-up next year. Two announcements = double the media.&quot;</li><li><strong>Frame as political win:</strong> &quot;Piloting first = &#39;responsible government,&#39; not &#39;reckless spending.&#39; Opposition can&#39;t attack.&quot;</li><li><strong>Offer alternative timing:</strong> &quot;Conference is in 3 months. What if we do soft launch (no media), official announcement 6 months when it&#39;s solid? You launch twice.&quot;</li></ol><p><strong>Win condition:</strong> Minister gets their announcement (pilot), you get time to deliver quality.</p><hr><h3 id="political-reality-4-the-union-will-slow-you-down-and-they-should" tabindex="-1">Political Reality #4: The Union Will Slow You Down (And They Should) <a class="header-anchor" href="#political-reality-4-the-union-will-slow-you-down-and-they-should" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Political Reality #4: The Union Will Slow You Down (And They Should)&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>The Issue:</strong> GSM changes workflows. Union sees job losses (even if you promise none).</p><p><strong>Union&#39;s position:</strong> &quot;We need to negotiate job classifications, reskilling, redeployment.&quot;</p><p><strong>Your timeline pressure:</strong> &quot;Negotiations take 6-12 months. We can&#39;t wait.&quot;</p><p><strong>Reality check:</strong> YES YOU CAN WAIT. Union has legitimate role.</p><p><strong>The Smart Play:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Engage union Month 1, not Month 11:</strong> Give them time to negotiate.</li><li><strong>No layoffs commitment:</strong> Put it in writing (it&#39;s cheaper than fighting them).</li><li><strong>Reskilling budget:</strong> Offer $2M for union-approved training programs (they look good to members).</li><li><strong>Union rep on governance:</strong> Seat at the table = co-ownership.</li></ol><p><strong>Win condition:</strong> Union president says &quot;we shaped this to protect workers&quot; instead of &quot;we&#39;re fighting management.&quot;</p><hr><h3 id="political-reality-5-you-will-lose-your-executive-sponsor" tabindex="-1">Political Reality #5: You Will Lose Your Executive Sponsor <a class="header-anchor" href="#political-reality-5-you-will-lose-your-executive-sponsor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Political Reality #5: You Will Lose Your Executive Sponsor&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Statistics:</strong> Average government CIO tenure: 18 months.
