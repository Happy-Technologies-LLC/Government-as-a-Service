However, reaching Level 3 typically requires 24-36 months of sustained investment.</li><li>Governments implementing GSM-aligned practices report satisfaction scores ranging from 7.2-8.4/10 (vs. 5.8-6.9/10 for traditional approaches). Attribution is challenging—satisfaction correlates with service quality, not just management frameworks.</li><li>Process redesign before technology deployment shows 54-73% lower failure rates in post-implementation reviews. The causation debate continues: is it the redesign itself, or that organizations mature enough to redesign first are simply better governed?</li><li>Continual improvement programs show annual efficiency gains of 3-12% in first 3 years, then diminishing returns (1-3% in years 4-6). The &quot;5-15% forever&quot; claim doesn&#39;t account for maturity curves.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference Implementations:</strong></p><ul><li>Singapore: GSM-style service management with 97% Singpass adoption (though mandatory for most services makes &quot;adoption&quot; somewhat compulsory). The $385M value figure is contested—does it include opportunity cost of alternatives?</li><li>Estonia: Once-only principle claimed to save 834 hours/year per citizen. Methodology: assumes every data reuse saves 15 minutes of form-filling. Critics note small population (1.3M) makes comprehensive integration feasible; less clear how this scales to 100M+ populations.</li><li>Denmark: Co-designed services achieving 87-92% digital adoption. The &quot;90% despite mandatory use&quot; framing is interesting—mandatory use partially drives adoption, so unclear how much co-design contributed vs. regulatory requirement.</li><li>UK GDS: Service standard defining excellence (2013-2016 era).
