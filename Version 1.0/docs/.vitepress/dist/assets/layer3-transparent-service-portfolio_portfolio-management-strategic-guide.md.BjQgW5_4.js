Process redesign <em>before</em> automation delivers 40-60% efficiency gains on its own—technology then multiplies that. But if you automate a broken process with untrained people, you just get a faster broken process that nobody uses.</p><p>The multiplier effect works like this: Skilled people using better processes enabled by technology = 10x improvement.
