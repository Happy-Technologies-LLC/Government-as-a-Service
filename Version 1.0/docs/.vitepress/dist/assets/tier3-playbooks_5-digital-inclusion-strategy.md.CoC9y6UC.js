It doesn&#39;t generate cost savings in the short term (you&#39;re maintaining multiple channels). It&#39;s politically sensitive (elderly voters matter). And success isn&#39;t a number on a dashboard - it&#39;s whether a 75-year-old grandmother can renew her pension without help, or a blind citizen can file taxes independently.</p><p>If you&#39;re doing this for cost savings, you&#39;ll fail. If you&#39;re doing it because it&#39;s the right thing to do - ensuring every citizen can access government services regardless of age, ability, location, or income - you&#39;ll succeed. But it will cost more and take longer than you think.</p><p>The countries that got this right (Denmark, UK, Estonia) committed for a decade, not 3 years. They funded it properly (5-10% of digital transformation budget, not an afterthought). They made it law (multi-channel access is a right, not optional). And they measured equity, not just adoption %.</p><p><strong>Be honest about the journey. It&#39;s worth doing. Just don&#39;t lie to yourself or your stakeholders about how long and expensive it will be.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Document Version:</strong> 2.0 <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-10-22 <strong>Owner:</strong> GaaS Implementation Team - Digital Inclusion Practice <strong>Status:</strong> Practitioner-Reviewed (Seeking Field Validation)</p><p>⚠️ <strong>CALL FOR PRACTITIONERS:</strong> If you&#39;ve run a digital inclusion program, please share your lessons learned.
