# GaaS Framework Overview

## The Integrated Operating Model

The Government as a Service (GaaS) framework provides a **complete operating model** for digital government transformation. Unlike traditional approaches that provide disconnected guidance, GaaS integrates **5 architectural layers** with a **dynamic process engine** to create a unified system for 21st-century governance.

### Two Integrated Views

**View 1: The 5-Layer Architecture (Static Structure)**
- Layer 0-4 define what government needs to operate digitally

**View 2: The GaaS Service Value System (Dynamic Process)**
- GSVS defines how work flows through the layers to deliver citizen value

Together, these create an **operating system for government** — not just a collection of documents, but an integrated model for transformation.

## Layer 0: Legal & Policy Foundation

**Purpose:** The legal bedrock enabling digital government
**Audience:** Political leaders, legal advisors, policy makers
**Content:** 26+ legislative templates and policy frameworks

### Why Layer 0 Comes First

Digital transformation without legal authority is futile. Layer 0 provides:
- Legal validity for digital transactions and signatures
- Data protection and privacy frameworks
- Cross-agency data sharing mandates
- Cybersecurity and risk management policies
- Algorithmic accountability and transparency requirements

**Without Layer 0:**
- Digital identities have no legal standing
- Electronic signatures cannot replace paper
- Data sharing across agencies remains illegal
- Privacy violations expose government to lawsuits

### Key Components

**Essential Legislative Framework (3 core acts):**
1. [Digital Identity Act](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/digital-identity-act) - Legal foundation for national digital ID
2. [Data Protection & Privacy Act](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/data-protection-privacy-act) - GDPR-aligned framework
3. [E-Government Services Act](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/e-government-services-act) - Digital-by-default mandate

**Enabling Policies (7 strategic):**
- [National Digital Strategy](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/national-digital-strategy-template)
- [API Governance Policy](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/api-governance-policy)
- [Cloud First Policy](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/cloud-first-policy)
- [Cybersecurity Act](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/cybersecurity-act)
- [Open Data & Transparency Act](/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/open-data-transparency-act)
- And more...

**Governance Documents (16 operational):**
- Digital Transformation Office Charter
- Chief Digital Officer Job Description
- PPT Balance Policy (40-40-20 investment mandate)
- Technology Selection Framework
- And more...

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Months 0-12):** Pass 3 essential acts
- **Phase 2 (Months 12-24):** Implement 7 enabling policies
- **Phase 3 (Months 24-36):** Deploy 16 governance documents

## Layer 1: Shared Technology Core

**Purpose:** "Build Once, Use Everywhere" shared platforms
**Audience:** CTOs, architects, platform engineers
**Content:** 3 comprehensive technical blueprints

### The Shared Core Principle

Instead of 200+ agencies each building their own identity system, API gateway, and cloud infrastructure, **Layer 1 provides shared platforms** that all agencies consume as services.

**Benefits:**
- **10-20x cost reduction** (shared vs. duplicated infrastructure)
- **Consistent security** (centralized, expert-led)
- **Faster time-to-market** (agencies focus on services, not infrastructure)
- **Interoperability by design** (common standards, protocols)

### Core Components

**Essential Platforms:**
1. **Digital Identity** - National identity system (Estonia X-Road, Singapore SingPass models)
2. **API Gateway** - Secure service integration (Kong, Apigee patterns)
3. **Core Data Registries** - Person, Business, Property, Address, Vehicle registries
4. **Cloud Infrastructure** - Multi-cloud resilient foundation
5. **Security Stack** - Zero-Trust architecture (NIST 800-207)
6. **Analytics & AI** - Centralized data platform

### Technical Blueprints

2. **[Technology & Platform Architecture](/layer1-shared-technology-core/volume-3-technology-platform-architecture)** - Infrastructure, security, data, DevOps specifications

### Investment Profile

**Modified PPT Balance for Infrastructure Phase:**
- 30% People (platform engineers, architects)
- 30% Process (deployment, operations)
- 40% Technology (infrastructure, licenses)

*Returns to standard 40-40-20 once operational*

### Implementation Timeline
- **Greenfield:** 24-36 months (build from scratch)
- **Transformation:** 36-48 months (migrate from legacy)
- **Acceleration:** 12-18 months (scale existing platforms)

## Layer 3: Transparent Service Portfolio

**Purpose:** Strategic portfolio management with radical transparency
**Audience:** Executives, ministers, portfolio managers
**Content:** 4 strategic management guides

### The Transparency Imperative

**Core Principle:** Government is a service enterprise. Every function is a "service" that must be cataloged, cost-allocated, performance-managed, and made visible to citizens.

**Technology Business Management (TBM)** is the methodology that makes this possible.

### What TBM Enables

**Before TBM:**
- Opaque IT budgets ($500M allocated, purpose unclear)
- No visibility into service costs (How much does passport renewal cost?)
- Unable to compare services (Healthcare portal vs. Education portal efficiency?)
- Cannot justify investment decisions

**After TBM:**
- **Full cost transparency:** "Healthcare IT: $120M/year, Education: $80M/year"
- **Service-level costing:** "Digital passport renewal: $2.50 per transaction"
- **Performance benchmarking:** "Healthcare portal: $15/transaction vs. industry standard $8"
- **Data-driven decisions:** "Invest $10M in automation → reduce cost from $15 to $5/transaction"

### Strategic Guides

1. **[Portfolio Management Strategic Guide](/layer3-transparent-service-portfolio/portfolio-management-strategic-guide)** - TBM framework, service catalog, value stream mapping (formerly Executive Playbook)
2. **[Fiscal Architecture](/layer3-transparent-service-portfolio/fiscal-architecture)** - Budget allocation, build vs. buy decisions, ROI methodology
3. **[Greenfield Implementation Guide](/layer3-transparent-service-portfolio/greenfield-implementation-guide)** - 18-month roadmap for new governments

### Real-World Impact

**Queensland Government (Australia):**
- Catalogued 600+ services, identified $920M duplicate spending
- TBM-driven portfolio optimization saved 15-20% annually

**US Veterans Affairs:**
- Mapped $4.6B IT budget to 180 services
- Redirected $1.6B from legacy to veteran-facing services

**Singapore GovTech:**
- Published TBM cost-benefit for MyInfo: $50M investment, $385M annual value, 7.7:1 ROI

## Layer 4: Unified Citizen Experience

**Purpose:** The single "front door" to all government services
**Audience:** UX designers, citizen experience teams, community managers
**Content:** 6 citizen experience and co-design guides

### The Unified Portal Vision

**Current Reality (Most Governments):**
- 200+ agency websites with inconsistent UX
- Citizens must know which agency provides which service
- Redundant data entry (same information entered 10+ times)
- No mobile-first design (50%+ drop-off on mobile)
- Reactive service delivery (citizens initiate everything)

**GaaS Vision:**
- **One portal** for all services (web, mobile, voice, in-person, SMS)
- **Once-only principle** - government reuses data internally
- **Proactive services** - government anticipates needs based on life events
- **Personalization** - AI-powered recommendations
- **Omnichannel** - seamless experience across all channels

### Core Components

**Portal Architecture:**
1. **[Unified Citizen Portal](/layer4-unified-citizen-experience/layer4-overview)** - Single-sign-on, personalized dashboard, 1,000+ services
2. **[Community Platform](/layer4-unified-citizen-experience/community-platform-overview)** - Co-design and feedback mechanism (formerly Tier 5 Community Hub)
3. **[Certification Program](/layer4-unified-citizen-experience/certification-program)** - Professional credentials for CX practitioners
4. **[Implementation Registry](/layer4-unified-citizen-experience/implementation-registry)** - Track 60+ country implementations
5. **[Events Program](/layer4-unified-citizen-experience/events-program)** - Global summits and workshops
6. **[Governance Model](/layer4-unified-citizen-experience/governance-model)** - Democratic community structure

### Success Metrics

**Citizen Outcomes:**
- Digital adoption: >80% of transactions
- Citizen satisfaction: NPS >50, CSAT >4.5/5.0
- Time saved: 20+ hours per citizen per year
- Inclusion: >60% of elderly using digital services

**Real-World Leaders:**
- **Estonia:** 99% services online, 15 minutes/year average citizen interaction
- **Singapore LifeSG:** 4M+ users, 95% satisfaction, proactive lifecycle services
- **Denmark borger.dk:** 90% citizen satisfaction, 80% digital adoption

## The GaaS Service Value System (GSVS)

**The Dynamic Engine That Ties Everything Together**

While Layers 0-4 define the **static structure** (what government needs), the **GaaS Service Value System** defines the **dynamic process** (how work flows through the system to deliver value).

### The 5 Components of GSVS

**1. Guiding Principles** (from The Manifesto)
- Digital-by-default, Once-only, Omnichannel, Transparent, Secure

**2. Governance** (Layer 0 + Layer 3)
- Steering committees, PPT Balance Council, TBM oversight

**3. The Service Value Chain** (All 5 Layers)
- **Mandate** (Layer 0) → Identify need, pass legislation
- **Architect** (Layer 1 + Layer 0) → Design solution using blueprints
- **Build/Acquire** (Layer 2 + Layer 1) → Implement using Agile + platforms
- **Transition** (Layer 2 + Layer 3) → Test, release, catalog with TBM costs
- **Deliver & Support** (Layer 3 + Layer 4 + Layer 2) → Operate, portal, service desk

**4. Practice & Blueprint Library** (Layers 0, 1, 2)
- All legislative templates, blueprints, playbooks = the "toolbox"

**5. Continual Improvement** (Layer 4 → all layers)
- Citizen feedback (Layer 4) + TBM data (Layer 3) drive optimization

### How It Works: Complete Example

**Scenario: National Payments Platform**

1. **Mandate (Layer 0):** Parliament passes Digital Payments Act
2. **Architect (Layer 1):** Use Layer 1 Payment Blueprint + Estonia X-Road model
3. **Build (Layer 2):** Agile team + platform engineers deliver in 12 sprints
4. **Transition (Layer 2+3):** ITIL release management + catalog with TBM cost ($5M capex, $2M/year opex)
5. **Deliver (Layer 3+4+2):** Managed in Layer 3 portfolio, accessible via Layer 4 portal, supported by Layer 2 service desk

**Result:** Integrated payments platform operational in 12 months, full transparency, 99.9% uptime

## What's New in GaaS v1.0

**Architecture Evolution:**

The GaaS framework has evolved from a **tier-based "library"** (disconnected collection of assets) to a **layer-based "operating system"** (integrated model for government).

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **5-Layer Architecture** (replaces old Tier 0-5 structure)
- ✅ **GaaS Service Value System** (new integration mechanism showing how layers work together)
- ✅ **40-40-20 PPT Balance** (embedded throughout framework)
- ✅ **TBM Integration** (Layer 3 enables radical cost transparency)
