## Remaining Commercial References (Acceptable)

Some commercial products remain where appropriate:

### Infrastructure/Cloud (Commodity Services)
- AWS, Azure, GCP (via standard APIs, no lock-in)
- Microsoft 365, Google Workspace (office productivity)

**Rationale:** Commodity services with low strategic risk, standard APIs, no vendor lock-in

### Specialized/Regulated (No Open Alternative)
- Payment gateways (Stripe, Adyen) - Regulated industry
- Contact centers (Genesys, Five9) - Specialized, low strategic risk
- Identity providers (Okta, Auth0) - Can use open standards (OAuth, SAML)

**Principle:** Use commercial for commodity, use open source for strategic systems

## Verification

**Remaining proprietary references:** 0 (in strategic context)

**All references now:**
- ✅ Open international standards (ITIL, ISO 20000, COBIT, TBM)
- ✅ Open-source tools (iTop, GLPI, GitLab, Mattermost, etc.)
- ✅ Industry-standard patterns (CSDM) not vendor-specific
- ✅ Generic descriptions ("commercial ITSM platforms" vs. naming vendors)

**Total files modified:** 16
**Total lines added:** ~1,500 (new documents + updates)

---

## Impact

### For Governments
✅ Clear: GaaS Platform and framework are 100% free and open
✅ No vendor lock-in concerns
✅ Sovereignty and transparency guaranteed
✅ Budget spent on people/processes, not vendor fees
✅ Aligns with "public money = public code" movement

### For Contributors
✅ AGPLv3 ensures all contributions stay open
✅ Community governance, not vendor control
✅ Transparent roadmap and decision-making

### For Adoption
✅ Compatible with government procurement favoring open source
✅ International standards-based (ITIL, ISO 20000)
✅ No licensing costs or recurring fees
✅ Full cost transparency: $0 licenses vs. $50M-500M commercial

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Technical design cleaned
2. ✅ Docs site cleaned
3. ✅ Open source commitment documents created
4. ⏭️ Update main README.md to prominently feature open source commitment
5. ⏭️ Add badge to docs site: "100% Open Source - AGPLv3"
6. ⏭️ Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear open-source guidelines
7. ⏭️ Set up GitHub repository with AGPLv3 license

**Principle Established:**

> The Government as a Service framework and GaaS Platform exist to serve the public good, not generate profit. Digital government infrastructure should be a public utility—transparent, sovereign, secure, and sustainable through open source.
