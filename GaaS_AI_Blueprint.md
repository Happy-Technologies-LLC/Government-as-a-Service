# Master Blueprint: Re-Architecting the Government as a Service (GaaS) Framework

**To the AI:** Your task is to perform a complete content and structural migration. You will deconstruct the old, "Tier-based" Government as a Service (GaaS) framework and re-architect it into the new, integrated **GaaS Operating Model**.

This document is your *only* set of instructions. Follow it precisely.

## 1. The Goal: From Library to Operating System

* **The "As-Is" (Old GaaS):** A-la-carte Tiers 0-5. A "library" of useful, but disconnected, assets.
* **The "To-Be" (New GaaS):** A single, holistic "operating system" for a government.

Your job is to read, understand, synthesize, and rewrite the old content to fit this new, superior model.

## 2. The Target Architecture (The "To-Be" State)

This is the model you must build, as defined in `Problem_Solution.md`. It has two integrated views:

**View 1: The GaaS Architectural Framework (The Static Structure)**
* **Layer 0:** The Legal & Policy Foundation
* **Layer 1:** The Shared Technology Core
* **Layer 2:** The People & Process Engine
* **Layer 3:** The Transparent Service Portfolio
* **Layer 4:** The Unified Citizen Experience

**View 2: The GaaS Service Value System (The Dynamic Process)**
* **Guiding Principles:** The "why."
* **Governance:** The "steering wheel" and controls.
* **The Service Value Chain:** The "engine" (Mandate -> Architect -> Build -> Transition -> Deliver/Support).
* **Practice & Blueprint Library:** The "toolbox."
* **Continual Improvement:** The "feedback loop."

## 3. Source Material Audit (The "As-Is" Content)

This is the old GaaS framework. Before migrating, you must understand what "knowledge" is in each Tier:

* **`Old Tier 0 (Manifesto)`:** Contains the *vision, philosophy, and guiding principles*. The "why" of the entire framework.
* **`Old Tier 1 (Executive Playbook)`:** Contains *strategic guidance for leaders*, focusing on portfolio management, business cases, and TBM.
* **`Old Tier 2 (Technical Blueprints)`:** Contains *hard technical architectures* (e.g., Digital ID, Payments) AND *organizational design* (e.g., People & Org Architecture). **This Tier must be split up.**
* **`Old Tier 3 (Implementation Playbooks)`:** Contains *process-centric "how-to" guides* (e.g., Agile, ITIL, Service Desk). This is the "how-to" for the *workforce*.
* **`Old Tier 4 (Policy & Legal Templates)`:** Contains *draft legislation and policy documents*. These are the "rules" and "authority."
* **`Old Tier 5 (Community Hub)`:** Contains strategies for *public engagement, feedback, and co-design*.

## 4. AI Task 1: Build the GaaS Architectural Framework (The 5 Layers)

Your primary task is to delete the old Tier 0-5 structure and generate the 5 new "Layer" sections. For each new Layer, you will create a landing page and migrate the old content into it as sub-pages.

### New Section 1: `Layer 0: The Legal & Policy Foundation`

* **Purpose:** To establish that a digital government must be built on a foundation of law and authority, not just technology.
* **Source Content:** `Old Tier 4 (Policy & Legal)` and `Old Tier 0 (Manifesto)`.
* **AI Writing Instructions:**
    1.  Create a new landing page for "Layer 0."
    2.  Write an introduction explaining that this layer is the "bedrock" and "legal authority" for the entire GaaS.
    3.  Use the `Old Tier 0 Manifesto` as the *political and philosophical justification* for this layer.
    4.  Migrate all content from `Old Tier 4` into this section as sub-pages (e.g., "Template: Digital Identity Act," "Template: Data Sovereignty Policy").

### New Section 2: `Layer 1: The Shared Technology Core`

* **Purpose:** To detail the "Build Once, Use Everywhere" shared technology platforms that all agencies must use.
* **Source Content:** `Old Tier 2 (Technical Blueprints)`.
* **AI Writing Instructions:**
    1.  Create a new landing page for "Layer 1."
    2.  Write an introduction explaining that this is the *core technology infrastructure* based on principles like Zero-Trust and API-first interoperability.
    3.  **CRITICAL:** Migrate all *technical* blueprints from `Old Tier 2` here (e.g., "Digital Identity Blueprint," "Payments Blueprint," "Data Exchange Blueprint").
    4.  **CRITICAL:** You MUST *exclude* the `Tier 2 (People & Organizational Architecture)` content. It belongs in Layer 2.

### New Section 3: `Layer 2: The People & Process Engine`

* **Purpose:** To define the "how" and "who" of running the government. This is the operational "factory floor."
* **Source Content:** `Old Tier 3 (Implementation Playbooks)` and the `Old Tier 2 (People & Org Architecture)` volume.
* **AI Writing Instructions:**
    1.  Create a new landing page for "Layer 2."
    2.  Write an introduction explaining this is the "engine" of the government, comprised of its *People* and its *Processes*.
    3.  Create a "People" sub-section. Migrate the `Old Tier 2 (People & Org Architecture)` content here. Frame it as the blueprint for the GaaS workforce.
    4.  Create a "Process" sub-section. Migrate all `Old Tier 3` playbooks here. Frame them as the official operating procedures (e.g., "Process: Agile Delivery," "Process: Service Management (ITIL)").

### New Section 4: `Layer 3: The Transparent Service Portfolio`

* **Purpose:** To define the "what" the government delivers: a managed portfolio of public services.
* **Source Content:** `Old Tier 1 (Executive Playbook)`.
* **AI Writing Instructions:**
    1.  Create a new landing page for "Layer 3."
    2.  Write an introduction explaining that *all* government functions are "services" that must be managed in a transparent portfolio.
    3.  This section *must* introduce **Technology Business Management (TBM)** as the core methodology for achieving "Radical Transparency" (linking cost to value).
    4.  Migrate the `Old Tier 1 Exec Playbook` here. Reframe its title and introduction to be the "Strategic Guide to Service Portfolio Management."

### New Section 5: `Layer 4: The Unified Citizen Experience`

* **Purpose:** To define the "front-door" — the single, omnichannel experience for all citizens.
* **Source Content:** `Old Tier 5 (Community Hub)`.
* **AI Writing Instructions:**
    1.  Create a new landing page for "Layer 4."
    2.  Write an introduction explaining this is the unified "UX/UI" of the government (portal, app, etc.).
    3.  Migrate all `Old Tier 5` content here.
    4.  Reframe the "Community Hub" as the *methodology* for the "Continual Improvement" and *co-design* of this Experience Layer, ensuring citizens are part of the process.

## 5. AI Task 2: Build the GaaS Service Value System (The Process Page)

After building the 5 Layer sections, you must create one, **new** standalone page that shows how they all *work together*.

* **Page Title:** `The GaaS Service Value System: How It All Works`
* **AI Writing Instructions:**
    1.  Write an introduction that states this is the *dynamic process engine* that runs *on* the 5-Layer architecture.
    2.  Visually (or textually) lay out the 5 components of the GSVS (from `Problem_Solution.md`).
    3.  **For `Guiding Principles`:** State that these are defined in `Layer 0 (Manifesto)`.
    4.  **For `Governance`:** State that this is the function of leadership, using the tools in `Layer 3 (Portfolio/TBM)` and the rules from `Layer 0 (Policy)`.
    5.  **For `The Service Value Chain`:** This is the most important part. Write out the 5-step flow (Mandate, Architect, Build, Transition, Deliver/Support) and **explicitly link each step to the GaaS Layers it uses.**
        * *Example for "Architect":* "This step uses the `Core Blueprints` from **Layer 1** to design a solution."
        * *Example for "Build":* "This step uses the `Agile Playbook` and `People` from **Layer 2**."
        * *Example for "Deliver/Support":* "The service is now live in the **Layer 3 Portfolio**, accessed via **Layer 4**, and supported by the `Service Desk Playbook` in **Layer 2**."
    6.  **For `Practice & Blueprint Library`:** State that this "toolbox" is the *entirety* of the assets found in `Layer 1` and `Layer 2`.
    7.  **For `Continual Improvement`:** State that this feedback loop is powered by data from `Layer 4 (Community Feedback)` and `Layer 3 (TBM Performance Data)`.

## 6. Summary of AI Generation Tasks

1.  **Delete** the old "Tier 0-5" navigational structure.
2.  **Generate** 5 new top-level sections for `Layer 0` through `Layer 4`.
3.  **Perform** the content migration and synthesis for each Layer, as detailed in Section 4.
4.  **Generate** one new, standalone page ("The GaaS Service Value System") as detailed in Section 5.
5.  **Review** all new content to ensure cross-links are updated and old "Tier" language is replaced with new "Layer" language.
