# GaaS Framework Version 0.1 (Archived)

**Status:** Archived - Superseded by Version 1.0
**Date Archived:** November 2025
**Migration:** Tier-based structure → Layer-based architecture

---

## What's Here

This directory contains the **original tier-based structure** of the GaaS framework (Version 0.1), which has been superseded by the new **layer-based architecture** in Version 1.0.

### Original Structure (Tiers 0-5)

- **tier0-manifesto/** - The original manifesto
- **tier1-executive-playbook/** - Executive guidance and strategic planning
- **tier2-technical-blueprint/** - Technical architecture (3 volumes: People, Process, Technology)
- **tier3-playbooks/** - 10 implementation playbooks
- **tier4-policy-legal/** - 26+ legislative templates and policies
- **tier5-community/** - Community hub and engagement materials

---

## Why Was It Changed?

The tier-based structure presented GaaS as an "a-la-carte library" of disconnected documents. While comprehensive, it didn't effectively communicate how all components integrate as a unified operating system for government.

### Problems with Tier Structure:
1. **No clear integration** - Components appeared independent
2. **Unclear dependencies** - Which tier to implement first?
3. **Technology-centric framing** - Technical blueprints (Tier 2) positioned before operational processes (Tier 3)
4. **Policy positioned last** - Legal foundation (Tier 4) should come first, not fourth

---

## New Structure (Layers 0-4)

Version 1.0 reorganizes the same content into an integrated operating model:

### Layer 0: Legal & Policy Foundation
- **Source:** Tier 4 (Policy & Legal) + Tier 0 (Manifesto)
- **Why first:** Legal authority is the bedrock enabling everything else

### Layer 1: Shared Technology Core
- **Source:** Tier 2 (Technical Blueprints - Volumes 2 & 3)
- **Why second:** "Build Once, Use Everywhere" platforms that all agencies use

### Layer 2: People & Process Engine
- **Source:** Tier 3 (Implementation Playbooks) + Tier 2 (Volume 1: People & Org)
- **Why third:** The operational engine where services are built and managed

### Layer 3: Transparent Service Portfolio
- **Source:** Tier 1 (Executive Playbook)
- **Why fourth:** Strategic management of what government delivers with TBM cost transparency

### Layer 4: Unified Citizen Experience
- **Source:** Tier 5 (Community Hub)
- **Why fifth:** The single front-door citizens see and experience

Plus: **GaaS Service Value System (GSVS)** - The dynamic process showing how all layers work together

## Migration Mapping

| Old Tier | New Layer | Content Type |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Tier 0 | Layer 0 | Manifesto (political justification) |
| Tier 1 | Layer 3 | Executive Playbook → Portfolio Management |
| Tier 2 Vol 1 | Layer 2 | People & Organizational Architecture |
| Tier 2 Vol 2-3 | Layer 1 | Technical Blueprints & Platforms |
| Tier 3 | Layer 2 | Implementation Playbooks → Process Dimension |
| Tier 4 | Layer 0 | Policy & Legal Templates |
| Tier 5 | Layer 4 | Community Hub → Co-Design Mechanism |

## Should You Use This Version?

**NO - Use Version 1.0 instead.**

This archive is preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the evolution of the framework
- Reviewing original content organization
- Research purposes

**For current implementation, use:** `/Version 1.0/`

## Content Quality

All content in Version 0.1 was high quality and remains valuable. **No content was lost in the migration** - it was reorganized, reframed, and integrated into the new layer structure.

**Total Content:**
- ~50+ documents
- ~32,000+ lines of markdown
- 26+ legislative templates
- 10 implementation playbooks
- 3 technical blueprint volumes
- Real-world examples from Estonia, Singapore, UAE, Denmark

All of this content now lives in Version 1.0 with improved integration and clearer implementation pathways.

## Key Differences: Version 0.1 vs 1.0

| Aspect | Version 0.1 (Tiers) | Version 1.0 (Layers) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Structure** | 6 tiers (0-5) | 5 layers (0-4) + GSVS |
| **Presentation** | Library (a-la-carte) | Operating System (integrated) |
| **Starting point** | Manifesto (vision) | Legal foundation (authority) |
| **Technology position** | Tier 2 (second) | Layer 1 (shared core) |
| **People & Process** | Split across Tier 2-3 | Unified in Layer 2 (40-40-20) |
| **Policy position** | Tier 4 (fourth) | Layer 0 (first) |
| **Integration** | Implicit | Explicit via GSVS |
| **Value flow** | Unclear | Clear via Service Value Chain |
