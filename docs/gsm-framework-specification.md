# Government Service Management (GSM) Framework
## The Service Management Standard for Digital Government

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Official Specification

---

## Executive Summary

**Government Service Management (GSM)** is a purpose-built service management framework designed specifically for government digital transformation. While inspired by IT Service Management (ITSM) best practices, GSM is tailored to the unique context of government: citizen-centricity, democratic accountability, equity, transparency, and public value creation.

GSM provides governments with a comprehensive set of management practices, principles, and processes to deliver reliable, equitable, citizen-centric digital services with operational excellence and democratic accountability.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Citizen-first** (citizens have rights, not just preferences)
- **Equity and inclusion** as core principles
- **Democratic accountability** and transparency requirements
- **Whole-of-government** collaboration model
- **Public value optimization** (not just efficiency)
- **Long-term sustainability** across political cycles

## 1. GSM Service Value System

The GSM Service Value System describes how all components and activities of the organization work together as a system to enable value co-creation for citizens and society.

## 2. The 7 GSM Guiding Principles

These principles guide organizations in all circumstances, regardless of changes in goals, strategies, work, or management structure.

### Principle 1: Focus on Citizen Outcomes and Public Value
- Services must deliver measurable public value, not just efficiency
- Outcomes prioritized over outputs
- Equity considerations in all service decisions
- Long-term societal impact over short-term metrics

### Principle 2: Build on Existing Capabilities
- Start with current state assessment (people, process, technology)
- Leverage existing assets and investments
- Avoid "rip and replace" unless absolutely necessary
- Incremental improvement while planning transformational change

### Principle 3: Progress Iteratively with Transparency
- Deliver in small, manageable increments
- Demonstrate value early and often
- Maintain public transparency throughout transformation
- Learn from failures openly and adjust course

### Principle 4: Collaborate Across Government
- Break down silos between agencies and ministries
- Enable whole-of-government service delivery
- Share platforms, data, and capabilities
- Co-create solutions with citizens and stakeholders

### Principle 5: Think End-to-End Service Journeys
- Design services from the citizen perspective
- Map complete life events (birth, business, property, etc.)
- Eliminate handoffs and friction points
- Integrate across organizational boundaries

### Principle 6: Keep Services Simple and Accessible
- Avoid over-engineering and complexity
- Design for universal accessibility (no one left behind)
- Multiple channels for diverse populations
- Plain language and intuitive interfaces

### Principle 7: Optimize for Equity and Automate for Efficiency
- Automation serves equity goals, not replaces human judgment
- Measure impact on vulnerable populations
- Balance efficiency with fairness and inclusion
- Technology enables, not dictates, service design

## 3. GSM Service Value Chain

The Service Value Chain is the central element of the GSM Service Value System. It is an operating model outlining the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value realization through the creation and management of services.

### Value Chain Activities:

**1. PLAN (Democratic Mandate & Strategy)**
- **Purpose**: Ensure alignment with democratic mandates and citizen needs
- **Key Activities**: Strategic planning, portfolio management, policy alignment, budgeting
- **Outputs**: Service strategy, investment plans, governance frameworks

**2. IMPROVE (Continual Service Improvement)**
- **Purpose**: Ensure services continually evolve to meet changing needs
- **Key Activities**: Performance analysis, process optimization, innovation, lessons learned
- **Outputs**: Improvement initiatives, updated standards, capability enhancements

**3. ENGAGE (Citizens & Stakeholders)**
- **Purpose**: Build trust, gather requirements, co-create solutions
- **Key Activities**: Stakeholder mapping, co-design workshops, user research, feedback collection
- **Outputs**: Service requirements, citizen insights, engagement strategies

**4. DESIGN & CO-CREATE**
- **Purpose**: Design citizen-centric services with stakeholder input
- **Key Activities**: Service blueprinting, journey mapping, accessibility design, pilot testing
- **Outputs**: Service designs, prototypes, SLAs, operating models

**5. OBTAIN/BUILD (With Oversight)**
- **Purpose**: Acquire or develop service components with accountability
- **Key Activities**: Procurement, development, testing, compliance validation
- **Outputs**: Service components, platforms, contracts, audit trails

**6. DELIVER & SUPPORT**
- **Purpose**: Provide reliable, equitable services to all citizens
- **Key Activities**: Service desk operations, incident management, request fulfillment, monitoring
- **Outputs**: Delivered services, support responses, performance data
