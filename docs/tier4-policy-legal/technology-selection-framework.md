## Executive Summary

The Technology Selection Framework provides a structured, evidence-based approach for making technology decisions across government. It ensures that technology choices are aligned with strategic objectives, deliver value for money, minimize risk, and promote interoperability and sustainability.

**Key Principles**:
1. User needs drive technology choices, not vendor preferences
2. Prefer open standards and open source over proprietary
3. Reuse before buy, buy before build
4. Total cost of ownership over initial price
5. Evidence-based evaluation using objective criteria
6. Avoid vendor lock-in and promote interoperability
7. Consider sustainability and environmental impact

**When to Use**: This framework applies to all technology decisions valued at $100,000 or more, including software, platforms, infrastructure, and services.

## 3. Scoring Methodology

### 3.1 Weighted Scoring Model

Each technology option is scored using the weighted criteria:

**Calculation**:
```
Total Score = Σ(Criterion Score × Criterion Weight)

Example:
Strategic Alignment:     4 × 20% = 0.80
Functionality:           5 × 20% = 1.00
Total Cost:              3 × 20% = 0.60
Vendor/Ecosystem:        4 × 15% = 0.60
Technical Quality:       4 × 10% = 0.40
Interoperability:        5 × 10% = 0.50
Sustainability:          3 × 5%  = 0.15
                        _______________
Total Score:                      4.05
```

**Interpretation**:
- **4.0 - 5.0**: Excellent fit, recommended
- **3.0 - 3.9**: Good fit, acceptable
- **2.0 - 2.9**: Marginal fit, concerns
- **<2.0**: Poor fit, not recommended

### 3.2 Minimum Thresholds

Regardless of total score, technologies must meet minimum thresholds:
- Strategic Alignment: ≥3
- Functionality: ≥3
- Total Cost: ≥2 (may be higher if extraordinary value)
- Technical Quality: ≥3

**Failure to meet thresholds = automatic disqualification**

### 3.3 Comparative Evaluation

Always evaluate at least 3 options:
1. **Preferred solution**: Top-ranked option
2. **Alternative solution**: Second-best option
3. **Baseline/status quo**: Current approach or do-nothing

**Selection**: Choose highest-scoring option that meets all thresholds, unless there are compelling non-scored reasons documented in the decision record.

### 6.3 TCO Comparison Guidelines

When comparing options, normalize for:
- **Time period**: Use same evaluation period (typically 5 years)
- **Scope**: Ensure like-for-like functionality
- **Scale**: Adjust for expected user/transaction volumes
- **Risk**: Apply probability weighting to uncertain costs

**Red flags**:
- Initial cost far below competitors (may have hidden ongoing costs)
- Very high ratio of ongoing to initial costs (lock-in risk)
- Opaque pricing or "call for quote" on key components
- Significant costs outside vendor's proposal (integration, customization)
