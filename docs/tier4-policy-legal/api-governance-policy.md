## 1. Policy Statement

### 1.1 Purpose

This API Governance Policy establishes the mandatory requirements, standards, and governance processes for the design, development, publication, and management of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) across all government agencies.

The policy ensures that government APIs are:
- **Consistent**: Following common standards and design patterns
- **Secure**: Protecting sensitive data and systems
- **Interoperable**: Enabling seamless data exchange between systems
- **Discoverable**: Easy to find and understand for developers
- **Sustainable**: Managed throughout their entire lifecycle

### 1.2 Vision

"All government services will be designed API-first, enabling seamless integration, innovation, and data sharing across government and with external partnersâ€”creating a modern, connected digital government ecosystem."

### 1.3 Strategic Objectives

1. **Enable Digital Service Integration**: APIs as the foundation for whole-of-government service delivery
2. **Accelerate Innovation**: Open APIs enabling third-party innovation and economic growth
3. **Improve Efficiency**: Reusable APIs reducing duplication and development costs
4. **Enhance Data Sharing**: Secure, standardized data exchange across government

## 4. API Design Standards and Principles

### 4.1 Mandatory Design Principles

**RESTful API Design**

All government APIs must follow RESTful (Representational State Transfer) architectural principles:

- Use HTTP/HTTPS as transport protocol
- Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Use resource-based URLs (nouns, not verbs)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Support standard HTTP headers

**Example:**
```
Correct:   GET /api/v1/citizens/12345
           POST /api/v1/citizens
           PUT /api/v1/citizens/12345
           DELETE /api/v1/citizens/12345

Incorrect: GET /api/v1/getCitizen?id=12345
           POST /api/v1/createCitizen
```

**JSON as Default Format**

- APIs must support JSON as the default data format
- Use consistent JSON structure and naming conventions
- Support JSON Schema for request/response validation
- Other formats (XML, CSV) may be offered as alternatives

**Consistent Naming Conventions**

- Use lowercase with hyphens for URL paths: `/api/v1/tax-returns`
- Use camelCase for JSON field names: `{ "firstName": "John" }`
- Use plural nouns for resource collections: `/citizens` not `/citizen`
- Use consistent terminology across all government APIs

**Pagination for Large Datasets**

All APIs returning lists must support pagination:
- Default page size: 20 items
- Maximum page size: 100 items
- Support offset-based or cursor-based pagination
- Return total count and pagination metadata

**Example:**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "totalItems": 1500,
    "totalPages": 75,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "nextPage": "/api/v1/citizens?page=2"
  }
}
```

### 4.2 API Versioning Requirements

**Versioning Mandate**

All APIs must implement versioning to ensure backward compatibility:

- Version included in URL path: `/api/v1/resource`
- Major version increments for breaking changes (v1, v2, v3)
- Minor versions and patches do not require URL changes
- Document semantic versioning in API changelog

**Breaking Changes**

The following changes are considered breaking and require a new major version:
- Removing or renaming fields
- Changing field data types
- Removing or changing endpoints
- Changing authentication mechanisms
- Modifying error response structures

**Non-Breaking Changes**

The following changes are backward-compatible and do not require versioning:
- Adding new optional fields
- Adding new endpoints
- Adding new optional query parameters
- Expanding enum values (if handled gracefully)
- Performance improvements

**Version Support Policy**

- Support minimum of 2 major versions concurrently
- Deprecation notice: 12 months before version retirement
- Sunset notice: 6 months before version shutdown
- Communication via API changelog, developer emails, HTTP headers

**Example Deprecation Header:**
```
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT
Link: <https://api.gov/docs/migration-v2>; rel="deprecation"
```

### 4.3 Error Handling Standards

**Consistent Error Response Format**

All APIs must return errors in a standardized format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The request contains invalid data",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "taxFileNumber",
        "issue": "Invalid format. Expected: XXX-XXX-XXX"
      }
    ],
    "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890",
    "timestamp": "2024-11-15T14:30:00Z",
    "documentation": "https://api.gov/docs/errors#validation-error"
  }
}
```

**Standard HTTP Status Codes**

Use HTTP status codes correctly and consistently:

| Code | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 200 | OK | Successful GET, PUT, PATCH |
| 201 | Created | Successful POST creating a resource |
| 204 | No Content | Successful DELETE |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request format or parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid authentication |
| 403 | Forbidden | Authenticated but not authorized |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource does not exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Request conflicts with current state |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Server-side error |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Temporary service outage |

**Error Code Taxonomy**

Define agency-specific error codes with standard prefixes:
- `AUTH_*`: Authentication and authorization errors
- `VALIDATION_*`: Input validation errors
- `BUSINESS_*`: Business rule violations
- `SYSTEM_*`: System and infrastructure errors

### 4.4 Data Standards

**Standard Data Formats**

Use consistent formats for common data types:

| Data Type | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Date | ISO 8601 (date only) | `2024-11-15` |
| DateTime | ISO 8601 with timezone | `2024-11-15T14:30:00Z` |
| Time | ISO 8601 (time only) | `14:30:00` |
| Currency | Decimal with currency code | `{ "amount": 1234.56, "currency": "USD" }` |
| Phone | E.164 format | `+11234567890` |
| Postal Code | Country-specific format | `12345` or `SW1A 1AA` |
| Email | RFC 5322 | `citizen@email.com` |

**Reuse Common Data Models**

Agencies must reuse standard government data models where available:
- Citizen/Person model
- Business/Organization model
- Address model
- Document model

**Data Validation**

- Implement server-side validation for all inputs
- Return detailed validation errors (field-level)
- Use JSON Schema for request validation
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks

---

## 5. API Security Requirements

### 5.1 Authentication and Authorization

**Mandatory Authentication**

All APIs must implement authentication (except public read-only open data APIs):

**Supported Authentication Methods:**

| Method | Use Case | Implementation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **OAuth 2.0** | External third-party developers | Industry standard, token-based |
| **API Keys** | Machine-to-machine (low sensitivity) | Simple key in header or query param |
| **JWT (JSON Web Token)** | Internal government APIs | Stateless, claims-based |
| **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** | High-security government systems | Certificate-based authentication |

**OAuth 2.0 Requirements (External APIs)**

For APIs accessed by external developers:
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- Use government central OAuth provider (if available)
- Support scopes for fine-grained permissions
- Short-lived access tokens (1 hour maximum)
- Refresh tokens with rotation
- Revocation endpoint for token invalidation

**API Key Requirements (Internal APIs)**

For simpler internal APIs:
- Unique API key per consuming application
- Keys transmitted in HTTP header (not query string): `X-API-Key: <key>`
- Key rotation capability
- Audit logging of all API key usage
- Automatic expiration after 12 months

**Authorization**

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Authorize every API request (even authenticated users may not have permission)
- Return 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- Log all authorization failures for security monitoring

### 5.2 Transport Security

**HTTPS/TLS Mandatory**

- All APIs must use HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher
- HTTP must redirect to HTTPS
- Use strong cipher suites only
- Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header
- Valid, trusted TLS certificates (no self-signed certificates)

**Certificate Pinning**

For high-security APIs (containing sensitive data):
- Implement certificate pinning for mobile apps
- Document certificate pinning in API documentation
- Provide advance notice of certificate changes

### 5.3 Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Mandatory Rate Limiting**

All APIs must implement rate limiting to prevent abuse:

**Standard Rate Limits:**

| API Tier | Requests per Minute | Requests per Day | Burst Allowance |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Public (unauthenticated) | 10 | 1,000 | 20 |
| Standard (authenticated) | 100 | 10,000 | 200 |
| Premium (approved partners) | 1,000 | 100,000 | 2,000 |
| Internal (government) | 5,000 | Unlimited | 10,000 |

**Rate Limit Headers**

Return rate limit information in HTTP headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 75
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1605484800
```

When rate limit exceeded, return:
```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60

{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds."
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Data Security

**Data Classification**

All API data must be classified according to government data classification framework:

| Level | Description | API Requirements |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Public** | No harm if disclosed | Standard API security |
| **Internal** | Limited distribution within government | API key or OAuth, audit logging |
| **Confidential** | Significant harm if disclosed | Strong authentication, encryption at rest, audit logging |
| **Secret** | Serious harm if disclosed | mTLS, encryption at rest, field-level encryption, detailed audit logging |

**Sensitive Data Protection**

For APIs handling sensitive personal data:
- Do not log sensitive data (PII, credentials, health data)
- Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive fields
- Support data masking in API responses (e.g., mask all but last 4 digits)
- Return minimum necessary data (principle of least privilege)

**Example Masked Response:**
```json
{
  "taxFileNumber": "***-***-1234",
  "fullName": "John Smith",
  "dateOfBirth": "1980-XX-XX"
}
```

### 5.5 Security Testing

**Mandatory Security Testing**

All APIs must undergo security testing before production deployment:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security testing (DAST)
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable libraries and dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party penetration testing for high-risk APIs
- **API Security Audit**: Annual review by central cybersecurity team

**OWASP API Security Top 10**

All APIs must be assessed against OWASP API Security Top 10:
1. Broken Object Level Authorization
2. Broken Authentication
3. Broken Object Property Level Authorization
4. Unrestricted Resource Consumption
5. Broken Function Level Authorization
6. Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows
7. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
8. Security Misconfiguration
9. Improper Inventory Management
