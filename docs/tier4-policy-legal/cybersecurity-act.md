## COMMENTARY AND RATIONALE

### Purpose of This Legislative Template

This Cybersecurity Act provides a comprehensive legal framework for protecting critical infrastructure, government systems, and digital economy from cyber threats. It establishes:
- **National coordination**: Central authority and strategy
- **Risk-based regulation**: Proportionate to criticality and threat
- **Incident response**: Coordinated national capability
- **Public-private collaboration**: Shared responsibility and information sharing
- **International cooperation**: Cross-border threat response

The Act is modeled on best practices from:
- **Singapore**: Cybersecurity Act 2018
- **European Union**: NIS Directive and NIS2 Directive
- **United States**: Cybersecurity Act, CISA, sector-specific regulations
- **Australia**: Security of Critical Infrastructure Act
- **United Kingdom**: Network and Information Systems Regulations

### Key Design Choices

**1. Critical Infrastructure Focus**

The Act prioritizes CII—systems essential to society and economy. This concentrates resources where disruption would cause greatest harm while avoiding over-regulation of low-risk entities.

**Adaptation Note**: CII designation criteria should reflect national context (threats, dependencies, redundancies).

**2. Risk-Based Approach**

Requirements scale with risk:
- **CII**: Highest obligations (continuous monitoring, SOC, audits, reporting)
- **ESPs**: Moderate obligations (standards compliance, incident reporting)
- **Other entities**: Voluntary best practices, encouraged participation

This balances security with avoiding excessive compliance burden.

**3. Incident Reporting Mandate**

Mandatory incident reporting creates national situational awareness and enables coordinated response. Timeliness requirements reflect incident severity.

Safe harbor for good-faith reporting encourages transparency without fear of punishment.

**4. Information Sharing**

Cyber threats are information problems—sharing intelligence multiplies defensive capability. Voluntary participation mechanisms (confidentiality, safe harbor, reciprocal benefits) incentivize sharing.

**5. Coordinated National Response**

National CIRT provides capability beyond what individual entities can afford. Government investment in shared infrastructure (GSOC, threat intelligence, forensics) levels playing field.

**6. Criminal Penalties**

Strong criminal penalties deter cybercrime and support international law enforcement cooperation. Extraterritorial jurisdiction reflects borderless nature of cyber threats.

**7. International Cooperation**

Cyber threats don't respect borders. International cooperation on threat intelligence, incident response, and law enforcement is essential. Alignment with international standards facilitates cooperation.

### Relationship to Other Laws

This Act complements:
- **Data Protection Act**: Protects privacy while enabling security
- **Digital Identity Act**: Secures authentication infrastructure
- **E-Government Services Act**: Secures digital government services
- **Electronic Transactions Act**: Secures digital commerce
- **Criminal Code**: Prosecutes cybercriminals
- **Law Enforcement Acts**: Governs lawful access to data

Ensure consistency and resolve conflicts through coordination.

### International Standards

This Act incorporates:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **ISO/IEC 27001/27002** (Information Security Management)
- **IEC 62443** (Industrial Cybersecurity)
- **EU NIS Directive / NIS2**
- **Budapest Convention on Cybercrime**
