## 2. GSM Framework Overview

### 2.1 The 7 GSM Guiding Principles

All service management activities must align with these principles:

1. **Focus on Citizen Outcomes and Public Value** - Services deliver measurable public value, not just efficiency
2. **Build on Existing Capabilities** - Leverage current assets and improve incrementally
3. **Progress Iteratively with Transparency** - Deliver in small increments with public transparency
4. **Collaborate Across Government** - Break down silos and enable whole-of-government delivery
5. **Think End-to-End Service Journeys** - Design from citizen perspective across all channels
6. **Keep Services Simple and Accessible** - Universal accessibility with no one left behind
7. **Optimize for Equity and Automate for Efficiency** - Technology serves equity goals

### 2.2 GSM Service Value Chain

All services must implement the six value chain activities:

| Activity | Purpose | Key Outputs |
|----------|---------|-------------|
