## Executive Summary

This policy establishes the 40-40-20 People-Process-Technology (PPT) investment principle as mandatory for all digital transformation initiatives. This balanced approach ensures government avoids the common failure pattern of over-investing in technology while neglecting the people and process changes required for success.

**The 40-40-20 Principle**:
- **40% People**: Talent, change management, culture, leadership, training
- **40% Process**: Service design, GSM practices, governance, ways of working
- **20% Technology**: Platforms, tools, infrastructure, software

**Key Requirements**:
- All digital transformation budgets must allocate funds according to 40-40-20
- PPT Balance Council reviews and approves all major initiatives
- Quarterly rebalancing if deviation exceeds 10% in any category
- Investment tracking and public reporting

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This policy establishes PPT balance requirements to ensure:
- **Holistic Transformation**: Technology investments accompanied by people and process changes
- **Sustainable Change**: Long-term capability building, not just technology deployment
- **Value Realization**: Benefits achieved through adoption, not just implementation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduced failure rate through balanced investment
- **Cultural Transformation**: Building digital culture alongside digital tools

### 1.2 The PPT Balance Problem

**Common Failure Pattern**:
- Government spends 80% on technology, 15% on process, 5% on people
- Technology deployed but not adopted
- Processes remain manual despite automation
- Staff untrained and resistant to change
- Benefits unrealized despite large investment

**Evidence**:
- 70% of digital transformation initiatives fail or underdeliver (McKinsey, Gartner)
- #1 failure cause: Insufficient change management and training
- #2 failure cause: Poor process redesign
- Technology rarely the root cause of failure

**The PPT Solution**:
- Balanced investment ensures technology adoption
- Change management addresses resistance
- Process redesign realizes efficiency benefits
- Training builds capability and confidence

### 1.3 Scope

This policy applies to:
- **All digital transformation initiatives** >$[500K] total budget
- **Major service transformations** regardless of budget
- **Platform development and deployment** (identity, payments, data, cloud)
- **Agency transformation programs**
- **Government-wide initiatives** led by Digital Transformation Office

**Exemptions**:
- Infrastructure replacement (like-for-like) with no process change
- Security patching and maintenance
- Minor enhancements to existing services
- Emergency incident resolution

### 1.4 Authority

This policy is issued under the Government Service Management Policy and Digital Transformation Office Charter. Non-compliance may prevent project approval or release of funds.

**A. Total Budget Breakdown**:
- Total initiative budget (multi-year if applicable)
- People allocation (must be 40% ± 5%)
- Process allocation (must be 40% ± 5%)
- Technology allocation (must be 20% ± 5%)

**B. Detailed People Investment Plan**:

- Applications: development, licensing, integration
- Data/analytics: platforms, tools

**E. PPT Balance Justification**:
- Explanation of allocation decisions
- Risks of imbalance
- Mitigation strategies
- Expected outcomes by category

**Step 2: Self-Assessment**

Before submission:
- Use PPT Balance Calculator (provided by DTO)
- Verify allocations fall within acceptable ranges (35-45% people, 35-45% process, 15-25% tech)
- If deviation >5%, prepare detailed justification
- Ensure all costs categorized appropriately

**Step 3: Submit for Review**

- Submit PPT balance plan with business case
- Include supporting documentation
- Submit minimum 2 weeks before desired approval date
- System assigns to PPT Balance Council agenda

### 4.2 Council Review and Decision

**Step 4: Council Assessment**

Council reviews:
- PPT allocation percentages
- Adequacy of people investment (will adoption succeed?)
- Adequacy of process investment (will value be realized?)
- Technology cost-effectiveness
- Change management comprehensiveness
- Risks and mitigation strategies

**Step 5: Council Decision**

Possible outcomes:

**A. Approved**:
- PPT balance acceptable (within 35-45% / 35-45% / 15-25%)
- People and process plans comprehensive
- Technology plans cost-effective
- No material concerns

**B. Conditionally Approved**:
- Minor PPT imbalance (5-10% deviation)
- Conditions specified that must be met before fund release
- Follow-up review required
- Example: "Approved conditional on expanding change management budget by $50K"

**C. Rejected - Rebalancing Required**:
- Significant PPT imbalance (>10% deviation)
- Inadequate people or process investment
- Technology over-specified relative to change readiness
- Must resubmit with rebalanced budget

**D. Rejected - Not Viable**:
- Fundamental flaws in approach
- Insufficient total budget for objectives
- Better alternatives exist
- Should not proceed

**Step 6: Decision Communication**

- Decision documented in Council minutes
- Email notification to initiative owner within 3 business days
- Detailed feedback for rejected/conditional approvals
- Approved initiatives added to monitoring list

### 4.3 Exceptional Approval (Fast-Track)

**Emergency Situations**:
- P1 incident requiring major investment

1. Initiative owner requests emergency review
2. E-Council convened (virtual, within 48 hours)
3. Abbreviated review (focus on most critical aspects)
4. Expedited decision
5. Retrospective full review at next regular Council meeting

**Note**: Even emergencies should aim for PPT balance where feasible.

## 6. Monitoring and Rebalancing

### 6.1 Ongoing Monitoring

**Monthly Tracking**:
- All approved initiatives report actual spending by PPT category
- Reported via project financial system
- Automated variance alerts if deviation >5%

**Quarterly Reviews**:
- PPT Balance Council reviews all initiatives >$1M
- Assess actual vs. planned allocation
- Identify trends and systemic issues
- Trigger rebalancing if needed

**Annual Assessment**:
- Comprehensive review of all initiatives
- Correlation analysis: PPT balance vs. success outcomes
- Policy updates based on learnings
- Best practice identification and sharing

### 6.2 Rebalancing Triggers

**Mandatory Rebalancing** if:
- Actual spending deviates >10% from approved allocation in any category
- People or Process spending <30% (too low)
- Technology spending >30% (too high)
- Major scope change affecting budget mix
- Initiative outcomes at risk due to imbalance

**Voluntary Rebalancing**:
- Initiative team identifies need for reallocation
- External factors change requirements
- Opportunities for optimization

### 6.3 Rebalancing Process

**Step 1: Identify Imbalance**
- Monthly variance report shows deviation >10%
- OR initiative team requests rebalancing
- OR Council proactively identifies issue

**Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**
- Why did imbalance occur?
- Poor initial planning?
- Changed circumstances?
- Cost overruns in one category?
- Underspend in another?

**Step 3: Develop Rebalancing Plan**
- Increase underspent categories (people/process usually)
- Options: Add training, expand change management, enhance service design
- Do NOT simply reprogram funds to technology
- Justify reallocation with expected benefits

**Step 4: Council Review**
- Submit rebalancing plan to Council
- Expedited review (2 weeks)
- Council approves or requires adjustments

**Step 5: Implementation**
- Execute approved rebalancing
- Update project plans and budgets
- Resume monthly monitoring

**Consequences of Refusing to Rebalance**:
- Budget hold (no additional funding releases)
- Project suspension if outcomes at risk
- Escalation to Chief Digital Officer
- Impact on future funding requests
