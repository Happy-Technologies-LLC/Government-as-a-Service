## 2. Identity Assurance Levels

### 2.1 Overview of Assurance Levels

The framework defines three dimensions of digital identity assurance based on NIST SP 800-63-3:

1. **Identity Assurance Level (IAL)**: Confidence that the person is who they claim to be
2. **Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL)**: Confidence that the person accessing the service is the rightful credential holder
3. **Federation Assurance Level (FAL)**: Strength of assertion and protection of information during federation

**Risk-Based Assurance Selection**

Services must select appropriate assurance levels based on risk assessment:

| Impact of Compromise | IAL | AAL | FAL |
|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **Low** (inconvenience, limited financial loss) | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Moderate** (financial loss, privacy harm) | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| **High** (serious financial loss, safety risk, criminal identity fraud) | 3 | 3 | 3 |

### 2.2 Identity Assurance Level (IAL)

**IAL 1: Self-Asserted Identity**

## 5. Authentication Methods

### 5.1 Passwordless Authentication (Recommended)

**FIDO2/WebAuthn (Strongest Security)**

**How It Works:**
1. User registers security key with government service
2. Security key generates cryptographic key pair (private key stored on device, public key sent to server)
3. To log in: User inserts security key, enters PIN or biometric
4. Security key signs challenge with private key
5. Server verifies signature with public key
6. User authenticated (no password needed)

**Benefits:**
- Phishing-resistant (cryptographic binding to website)
- No shared secrets (private key never leaves device)
- Convenient (no password to remember)
- Supports biometric (fingerprint, face) or PIN

**Supported Devices:**
- Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan Key, Feitian)
- Mobile devices (iOS, Android with biometric)
- Laptops with biometric sensors (Windows Hello, Touch ID)

**Deployment:**
- Offer as default authentication method for IAL 2, AAL 2
- Provide fallback method (password + TOTP) for users without compatible device

---

**Biometric Authentication (Mobile)**

**How It Works:**
1. User enrolls biometric on mobile device (fingerprint, face)
2. To log in: User opens government identity app
3. Biometric verification on device (fingerprint or face recognition)
4. App generates signed assertion
5. User scans QR code on government website or approves push notification
6. Assertion sent to website
7. User authenticated

**Benefits:**
- Highly convenient (no password, no typing)
- Strong security (biometric + device possession)
- User-friendly (especially for low-digital-literacy users)

**Privacy:**
- Biometric data never leaves device
- Only cryptographic assertion sent to server
- Government does not store biometric data

---

### 5.2 Fallback Authentication Methods

**Password + Authenticator App (TOTP)**

For users without security key or biometric device:

**Process:**
1. User enters username and password
2. User opens authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
3. User enters 6-digit code from app
4. User authenticated (AAL 2)

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters (recommend 12+)
- No complexity requirements (allow passphrases: "correct horse battery staple")
- Check against compromised password database (Have I Been Pwned API)
- Rate limiting (3 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout)
- Support password managers

---

**Smart Card + PIN (For Government Employees)**

**Process:**
1. User inserts smart card into card reader
2. User enters PIN
3. Smart card signs challenge with private key
4. User authenticated (AAL 3)

**Use Case:**
- Government employees accessing internal systems
- High-security environments

---

**Backup Codes (Recovery Method)**

**Purpose:** Allow access if primary authenticator lost or unavailable

**Process:**
1. User generates 10 single-use backup codes during enrollment
2. User stores codes securely (print and keep in safe place)
3. If primary authenticator unavailable, user enters backup code
4. Backup code consumed (single use)
5. User authenticated, prompted to reconfigure primary authenticator

**Security:**
- Backup codes hashed and salted (like passwords)
- Single use only
- Rate limited (3 attempts)

---

## 6. Credential Lifecycle Management

### 6.1 Credential Issuance

### 6.2 Credential Renewal

**Process:**
1. Citizen receives renewal notification (email, SMS, app push)
2. Citizen logs into identity portal
3. Confirm identity attributes still correct
4. Update photo if significantly changed (e.g., aging)
5. Re-verify identity (simplified process if no changes):
   - No changes: Self-service renewal (automatic)
   - Minor changes (address): Upload proof of address
   - Major changes (name): In-person or video verification
6. New credential issued

**Renewal Fee:**
- Free for standard renewal (every 5 years)
- Fee for lost/stolen credential replacement

### 6.3 Credential Suspension

**Reasons for Suspension:**
- User reports device lost or stolen
- Suspicious activity detected

**Process:**
1. User reports issue via helpline or identity portal
2. Credential immediately suspended (cannot be used for authentication)
3. User receives confirmation (email, SMS)
4. To reactivate:
   - Device found: User reactivates via web portal (after authentication with backup method)
   - Device stolen: Issue new credential (user re-enrolls biometric on new device)

### 6.4 Credential Revocation

**Reasons for Revocation:**
- Death of credential holder
- Fraud or identity theft detected
- Legal order (court order, law enforcement)

## 7. Privacy and Consent Management

### 7.1 Privacy Principles

**Data Minimization:**
- Collect only data necessary for identity proofing and authentication
- Services request only attributes they need (e.g., age verification, not full date of birth)
- Pseudonymous identifiers where possible (service-specific ID, not national ID number)

**User Control:**
- Citizens view and manage all data held about them
- Citizens control which services can access which attributes
- Citizens can revoke consent at any time

**Transparency:**
- Clear privacy policy in plain language
- Explain how data is used, stored, shared
- Audit logs: Citizens see who accessed their data and when

**Purpose Limitation:**
- Data used only for stated purpose (identity verification and authentication)
- No secondary use without consent
- No government data matching or profiling without legal basis

**Data Security:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls (need-to-know basis)
- Regular security audits
- Breach notification within 72 hours

### 7.2 Consent Management

**Attribute Release Consent**

When service requests identity attributes:

**Step 1: Service Requests Attributes**
- Service specifies which attributes it needs (name, email, date of birth, address)
- Service specifies why it needs each attribute (legal basis)

**Step 2: User Consent Prompt**
- User sees clear consent screen:
  - Service name and description
  - Attributes requested
  - Why each attribute is needed
  - How long service will retain data
  - Link to service privacy policy

**Step 3: User Decision**
- User approves (releases attributes to service)
- User denies (attributes not released, service access denied)
- User edits (releases some attributes but not others, if service allows)

**Step 4: Consent Recorded**
- Consent logged with timestamp, attributes released, user IP
- User can view and revoke consent in identity portal

**Example Consent Screen:**
```
Tax Filing Service is requesting access to:

âœ“ Full Name - Required to identify your tax account
âœ“ Date of Birth - Required to verify your identity
âœ“ Address - Required to send tax documents
âœ“ Email - Optional, for notifications

This service will retain your data for 7 years as required by law.

[View Privacy Policy]

[Approve] [Deny] [Edit]
```

**Ongoing Consent Management:**
- User views all active consents in identity portal
- User revokes consent at any time (service loses access immediately)
- Annual consent review prompt (confirm or revoke)

### 7.3 Audit Logging and Transparency

**User Activity Log:**

Citizens can view in identity portal:
- Login history (service, date/time, IP address, device)
- Attribute releases (service, attributes released, date/time)
- Consent changes (granted, revoked)
- Credential changes (issued, renewed, suspended)

**Retention:**
- Login history: 12 months
- Attribute releases: 7 years (compliance requirement)
- Consent logs: Duration of consent + 7 years

**Export:**
