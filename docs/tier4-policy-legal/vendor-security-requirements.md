- Classification of data accessed (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- Type of access (view only, modify, delete)
- Volume of data
- Criticality of systems
- Duration of engagement
- Vendor security maturity

### 2.2 Vendor Risk Tiers

| Risk Tier | Description | Examples | Security Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Tier 1 - Critical** | Access to Restricted data; Critical infrastructure; High privilege access | Cloud hosting for citizen services; Identity management platforms; National database hosting | Full compliance with all requirements; Annual third-party security audit; Continuous monitoring; Penetration testing |
| **Tier 2 - High** | Access to Confidential data; Moderate privilege; Significant data volume | Case management systems; HR platforms; Financial systems | Full baseline requirements; Annual vulnerability assessment; Security questionnaire |
| **Tier 3 - Medium** | Access to Internal data; Limited privilege; Moderate data volume | Productivity software; Collaboration tools; Low-sensitivity applications | Core baseline requirements; Self-assessment; Annual review |

## 11. Implementation Guidance

### 11.1 For Agencies: Implementing Vendor Security Requirements

**Phase 1: Policy Adoption (Months 1-2)**
1. Adopt this policy or adapt to agency-specific needs
2. Designate roles (CISO, vendor security coordinator)
3. Develop agency-specific templates (security questionnaire, contract clauses)
4. Train procurement and program staff

**Phase 2: Current Vendor Assessment (Months 3-6)**
1. Inventory all current vendor relationships
2. Classify vendors into risk tiers
3. Assess current vendor compliance with applicable requirements
4. Develop remediation plans for non-compliant vendors
5. Renegotiate contracts to include security requirements (at renewal or amendment)

**Phase 3: New Procurement Integration (Month 3 onwards)**
1. Incorporate security requirements into RFPs and contracts
2. Conduct security assessments during vendor evaluation
3. CISO approval before contract award
4. Track vendor security in vendor management system

**Phase 4: Ongoing Management (Continuous)**
1. Regular vendor compliance monitoring and reporting
2. Periodic re-assessments
3. Audit and inspection activities
4. Continuous improvement of vendor security program

**Resources Needed:**
- CISO and security team to conduct assessments and audits
- Procurement staff trained on security requirements
- Vendor management system or tool
- Budget for third-party security audits (if conducted by agency)

### 11.2 For Vendors: Achieving Compliance

**Self-Assessment:**
1. Review this policy and determine applicable risk tier
2. Complete security questionnaire (Appendix A)
3. Identify gaps between current state and requirements
4. Prioritize gaps based on severity and risk tier

**Remediation:**
1. Develop remediation plan with timelines
2. Allocate resources (budget, personnel)
3. Implement security controls (technical and organizational)
4. Document policies, procedures, and evidence of compliance

**Certification (if required):**
1. Engage third-party auditor for independent assessment
2. Remediate audit findings
3. Obtain certification (ISO 27001, SOC 2, FedRAMP, etc.)
4. Maintain certification through ongoing compliance

**Engagement with Agency:**
1. Proactively communicate security posture to agency
2. Provide evidence of compliance (policies, reports, certifications)
3. Report security incidents promptly
4. Participate in agency audits and assessments cooperatively

**Continuous Improvement:**
1. Monitor security landscape and emerging threats
2. Update controls and practices to address new risks
3. Participate in security training and awareness

## 13. Glossary

**Confidential Data:** Data requiring protection; unauthorized disclosure could have limited adverse impact. Most personal data and business information.

**Encryption at Rest:** Encryption of data stored on disk, database, or other persistent storage.

**Encryption in Transit:** Encryption of data while being transmitted over networks (e.g., TLS/SSL).

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Authentication using two or more factors (something you know, something you have, something you are).

**Penetration Testing:** Simulated cyberattack to evaluate security controls and identify vulnerabilities.

**Privileged Access:** Access with elevated permissions to modify systems, access sensitive data, or perform administrative functions.

**Restricted Data:** Highly sensitive data; unauthorized disclosure could cause serious harm (e.g., health records, financial details, national security information).

**Risk Tier:** Classification of vendor engagement based on risk to government (Tier 1 = Critical, Tier 2 = High, Tier 3 = Medium, Tier 4 = Low).

**Security Incident:** Event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or systems.

**Vulnerability Assessment:** Systematic review of security weaknesses in systems, applications, or networks.
