**Key Objectives:**
1. **Identify potential harms** before they occur
2. **Assess fairness and bias** across different population groups
3. **Ensure transparency** in how decisions are made
4. **Enable accountability** through clear governance
5. **Protect individual rights** including appeal and redress
6. **Promote public trust** through responsible AI practices

### 1.2 When AIA is Required

## Part 3: Supporting Resources

### Appendix A: Fairness Metrics Reference

**Common Fairness Definitions:**

1. **Demographic Parity**: P(Ŷ=1|A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|A=1)
   - Equal selection rates across groups

2. **Equalized Odds**: P(Ŷ=1|Y=y,A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=y,A=1) for y ∈ {0,1}
   - Equal true positive AND false positive rates

3. **Equal Opportunity**: P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=1)
   - Equal true positive rates (recall)

4. **Predictive Parity**: P(Y=1|Ŷ=1,A=0) = P(Y=1|Ŷ=1,A=1)
   - Equal precision across groups

5. **Calibration**: P(Y=1|Ŷ=p,A=a) = p for all p, a
   - Predicted probabilities match actual frequencies

*Note: These definitions may be mathematically incompatible; trade-offs are necessary.*

### Appendix B: Bias Mitigation Techniques Reference
