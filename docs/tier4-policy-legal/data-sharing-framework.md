## Government as a Service (GaaS) - Tier 4 Policy Template

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Template for National/Agency Adaptation
**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Template Classification:** Public

---

## Executive Summary

This Data Sharing Framework establishes the legal, technical, and operational foundation for secure and compliant data sharing between government agencies implementing the Government as a Service (GaaS) framework. It provides standardized principles, processes, and safeguards to enable efficient inter-agency collaboration while protecting citizen privacy and maintaining data security.

**Key Objectives:**
- Enable seamless, secure data sharing across government
- Protect individual privacy and maintain public trust
- Establish clear legal basis and accountability
- Standardize data classification and handling procedures
- Ensure audit trails and compliance monitoring

---

## 1. Policy Statement

### 1.1 Purpose

This Framework establishes the mandatory requirements and voluntary best practices for sharing data between government agencies within the GaaS ecosystem. It aims to:

1. **Maximize public value** through efficient data utilization
2. **Minimize citizen burden** by reducing duplicate data collection
3. **Protect privacy rights** through robust safeguards
4. **Enable innovation** while maintaining security
5. **Ensure accountability** through comprehensive audit mechanisms

### 1.2 Core Principles

**Principle 1: Once-Only**
Citizens and businesses should provide information to government only once. Agencies must share data to avoid duplicate collection.

**Principle 2: Privacy by Design**
Data protection measures must be embedded from the outset, not added as an afterthought.

**Principle 3: Purpose Limitation**
Data may only be used for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes agreed upon in advance.

**Principle 4: Data Minimization**
Only the minimum necessary data should be shared to accomplish the stated purpose.

**Principle 5: Security**
Appropriate technical and organizational measures must protect data throughout its lifecycle.

**Principle 6: Transparency**
Data subjects must be informed about how their data is being shared and used.

**Principle 7: Accountability**
Each party must demonstrate compliance and maintain evidence of data protection measures.

### 1.3 Legal Authority

This Framework operates under the authority of:

- **[National Data Protection Act]** - Primary privacy legislation
- **[E-Government Act]** - Digital government mandate
- **[Freedom of Information Act]** - Transparency requirements
- **[Cybersecurity Act]** - Security standards
- **[Specific enabling legislation]** - Agency-specific authorities

*Note: Agencies must cite specific legal provisions authorizing data sharing in each agreement.*

---

## 2. Scope and Applicability

### 2.1 In Scope

This Framework applies to:

**Organizations:**
- All government departments and agencies

- Administrative data (operational government records)
- Statistical and research data
- Real-time service delivery data
- Aggregated and anonymized datasets

**Sharing Mechanisms:**
- API-based real-time data exchange
- Bulk data transfers (batch processing)
- Federated query systems
- Shared databases and data warehouses
- Manual data transfers (exceptional cases)

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- National security matters (with appropriate oversight)
- Law enforcement investigations (with judicial authorization)

*All exemptions must be documented, time-limited, and subject to review.*

---

## 3. Data Sharing Principles

### 3.1 Legal Basis for Sharing

Every data sharing arrangement MUST establish a clear legal basis. Acceptable bases include:

**A. Statutory Mandate**
Legislation explicitly requires or authorizes the sharing.

*Example: Tax authority must share income data with social services for means-testing.*

**B. Public Interest**
Sharing is necessary for a public function or to protect vital interests.

*Example: Sharing health emergency data to coordinate pandemic response.*

**C. Consent**
The data subject has provided explicit, informed consent for sharing.

*Example: Citizen authorizes sharing employment history with housing agency for benefit application.*

**D. Contractual Necessity**
Sharing is required to fulfill a service or benefit to which the individual is entitled.

*Example: Sharing identity verification data to process driver's license renewal.*

**E. Vital Interests**
Sharing is necessary to protect life or prevent serious harm.

*Example: Sharing medical information during emergency response.*

### 3.2 Data Classification Framework

All data must be classified according to sensitivity:

| Classification | Definition | Examples | Baseline Safeguards |
|---------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Public** | Information intended for public release | Published statistics, public notices | Standard web security |
| **Internal** | Non-public operational data with low sensitivity | Meeting schedules, draft reports | Access authentication |
| **Confidential** | Data requiring protection; limited disclosure impact | Most citizen records, business data | Encryption in transit, role-based access |
| **Restricted** | Highly sensitive; serious harm if disclosed | Financial details, health records | Encryption at rest and in transit, multi-factor auth, audit logging |
| **Secret** | Most sensitive; critical harm if disclosed | National security, criminal intelligence | Air-gapped systems, specialized security clearance |

### 3.3 Data Handling Requirements

**For All Data Classifications:**
- Unique identifiers for all data sharing transactions
- Timestamp and user attribution for all access
- Regular review of access permissions (minimum annually)
- Secure deletion when retention period expires

**Additional Requirements by Classification:**

**Confidential Data:**
- Encrypted transmission (TLS 1.3 or equivalent)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Monthly access audits
- Data masking for non-authorized viewers

**Restricted Data:**
- End-to-end encryption
- Multi-factor authentication for all access
- Real-time access monitoring and alerting
- Quarterly security assessments
- Data loss prevention (DLP) controls
- Anonymization or pseudonymization where feasible

**Secret Data:**
- Handled under separate classified framework
- Physical and logical segregation
- Security clearance requirements
- Continuous monitoring
