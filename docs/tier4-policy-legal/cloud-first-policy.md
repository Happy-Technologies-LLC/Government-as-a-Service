- Accessible from anywhere

**Procurement Considerations:**
- Prefer government-approved SaaS catalog
- Review data location and sovereignty terms
- Ensure data portability and export capabilities
- Negotiate government-specific terms (security, audit rights)
- Understand subscription costs and scaling model

**Example SaaS Solutions:**
- Email and collaboration: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace
- HR and payroll: Workday, SAP SuccessFactors
- Customer relationship management: Salesforce
- Project management: Asana, Jira, Monday.com
- Finance and accounting: NetSuite, Xero

### 3.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**When to Use:**
- Custom application development
- Modernizing legacy applications
- API development and integration
- Microservices architectures
- Containerized applications

**Benefits:**
- Focus on application development, not infrastructure
- Built-in development tools and services

### 3.3 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**Definition**: Virtual computing infrastructure (servers, storage, networking); provider manages physical infrastructure, organization manages OS, middleware, and applications.

**When to Use:**
- Maximum control over infrastructure required
- Legacy application "lift and shift" migration
- Custom infrastructure configurations
- Specific OS or software version requirements

**Benefits:**
- Full control over virtual infrastructure
- Pay only for resources used
- Rapid provisioning (minutes vs. weeks)
- Global availability and redundancy
- Easy to scale resources

**Use with Caution:**
- IaaS requires more management than PaaS/SaaS
- Consider PaaS alternatives before choosing IaaS
- Use Infrastructure as Code for all IaaS deployments
- Implement auto-scaling and right-sizing

**Example Use Cases:**
- Lift-and-shift migration of legacy applications
- Custom enterprise applications
- Big data processing clusters

- Migrate to managed services without major code changes
- **Effort**: Medium | **Time**: Medium (months) | **Cost**: Good savings
- **Best for**: Database migrations, adding managed services
- **Example**: Migrate on-prem SQL Server to AWS RDS or Azure SQL Database

**6. Repurchase**
