# Tier 3 Implementation Playbook #2: API Gateway Deployment

## PPT Investment Breakdown

This playbook follows the People-Process-Technology (PPT) framework to ensure balanced investment across all critical dimensions of API gateway deployment.

**Investment Allocation:**
- **People (25%):** $0.75-2M - Team hiring, developer training, API community building, agency enablement
- **Process (35%):** $1.05-2.8M - API governance, design standards, documentation, lifecycle management, security policies
- **Technology (40%):** $1.2-3.2M - Gateway platform, infrastructure, monitoring tools, developer portal

**Total Investment:** $3-8M (varies by scale and vendor choice)

This allocation reflects the process-intensive nature of API management, where governance, standards, and documentation consume more effort than traditional technology projects. The lighter people investment recognizes that API platforms require smaller specialized teams rather than large operational staff.

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Domain name for API gateway (api.gov.xx)
- SSL/TLS certificates (ACM or bring your own)
- VPC with public and private subnets

**Step 1: Network Setup**
```bash
# Create VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=vpc,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=api-gateway-vpc}]'

# Create public subnets (for load balancer)
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-xxx --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24 --availability-zone us-east-1a
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-xxx --cidr-block 10.0.2.0/24 --availability-zone us-east-1b

# Create private subnets (for API gateway nodes)
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-xxx --cidr-block 10.0.10.0/24 --availability-zone us-east-1a
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-xxx --cidr-block 10.0.11.0/24 --availability-zone us-east-1b

# Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Route Tables (omitted for brevity - see IaC templates)
```

**Step 2: Database Setup (RDS PostgreSQL)**
```bash
# Create database subnet group
aws rds create-db-subnet-group \
  --db-subnet-group-name api-gateway-db-subnet \
  --subnet-ids subnet-xxx subnet-yyy \
  --db-subnet-group-description "API Gateway DB Subnets"

# Create RDS PostgreSQL instance (Multi-AZ for HA)
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier api-gateway-db \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.medium \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version 14.7 \
  --master-username apigateway \
  --master-user-password <secure-password> \
  --allocated-storage 100 \
  --storage-type gp3 \
  --multi-az \
  --db-subnet-group-name api-gateway-db-subnet \
  --vpc-security-group-ids sg-xxx \
  --backup-retention-period 7 \
  --preferred-backup-window "03:00-04:00" \
  --preferred-maintenance-window "mon:04:00-mon:05:00"
```

**Step 3: Cache Setup (ElastiCache Redis)**
```bash
# Create cache subnet group
aws elasticache create-cache-subnet-group \
  --cache-subnet-group-name api-gateway-cache-subnet \
  --subnet-ids subnet-xxx subnet-yyy \
  --cache-subnet-group-description "API Gateway Cache Subnets"

# Create Redis cluster (Cluster mode enabled for sharding)
aws elasticache create-replication-group \
  --replication-group-id api-gateway-cache \
  --replication-group-description "API Gateway Cache" \
  --engine redis \
  --cache-node-type cache.t3.medium \
  --num-node-groups 2 \
  --replicas-per-node-group 1 \
  --cache-subnet-group-name api-gateway-cache-subnet \
  --security-group-ids sg-xxx \
  --at-rest-encryption-enabled \
  --transit-encryption-enabled \
  --automatic-failover-enabled
```

**Step 4: API Gateway Deployment (EKS - Kong Example)**
```bash
# Create EKS cluster
eksctl create cluster \
  --name api-gateway-cluster \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --nodegroup-name api-gateway-nodes \
  --node-type t3.large \
  --nodes 3 \
  --nodes-min 3 \
  --nodes-max 10 \
  --managed

# Install Kong via Helm
helm repo add kong https://charts.konghq.com
helm repo update

helm install kong kong/kong \
  --namespace kong \
  --create-namespace \
  --set ingressController.enabled=true \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false \
  --set env.database=postgres \
  --set env.pg_host=<RDS-endpoint> \
  --set env.pg_user=apigateway \
  --set env.pg_password=<password> \
  --set env.pg_database=kong \
  --set proxy.type=LoadBalancer \
  --set admin.enabled=true
```

**Step 5: TLS Certificate (ACM)**
```bash
# Request certificate
aws acm request-certificate \
  --domain-name api.gov.xx \
  --subject-alternative-names *.api.gov.xx \
  --validation-method DNS

# Validate via DNS (add CNAME record to Route 53 as instructed)

# Associate with Load Balancer (done via K8s service annotation or ALB)
```

**Step 6: DNS Configuration (Route 53)**
```bash
# Create hosted zone (if not exists)
aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name gov.xx --caller-reference $(date +%s)

# Create A record pointing to load balancer
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z123456 \
  --change-batch '{
    "Changes": [{
      "Action": "CREATE",
      "ResourceRecordSet": {
        "Name": "api.gov.xx",
        "Type": "A",
        "AliasTarget": {
          "HostedZoneId": "Z215JYRZR1TBD5",
          "DNSName": "<lb-dns-name>",
          "EvaluateTargetHealth": false
        }
      }
    }]
  }'
```

**Step 7: Monitoring Setup (Prometheus + Grafana)**
```bash
# Install Prometheus via Helm
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --create-namespace

# Configure Kong to expose metrics
kubectl patch service kong-kong-proxy \
  --namespace kong \
  --patch '{"spec":{"ports":[{"name":"metrics","port":8100,"targetPort":8100}]}}'

# Import Kong dashboards to Grafana
# (Dashboards available at https://github.com/Kong/kong-grafana)
```

**Step 8: Security Hardening**
```bash
# Enable WAF (AWS WAF)
aws wafv2 create-web-acl \
  --name api-gateway-waf \
  --scope REGIONAL \
  --default-action Allow={} \
  --rules file://waf-rules.json \
  --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=apiGatewayWAF

# Associate WAF with ALB
aws wafv2 associate-web-acl \
  --web-acl-arn arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:regional/webacl/api-gateway-waf/xxx \
  --resource-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/kong/xxx

# Enable DDoS protection (AWS Shield Standard is default, consider Shield Advanced)
aws shield subscribe --subscription
```

## Security Configuration

### **Authentication Methods**

#### **1. OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (User-Delegated Access)**

**Use Case:** Mobile apps or web apps accessing APIs on behalf of users

**Flow:** Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
```
User → App → Redirect to IdP (Digital Identity) → User Authenticates
→ Authorization Code → App → Exchange for Access Token → API Gateway
→ Validate Token → Forward to Backend API
```

**Kong Configuration:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - name: openid-connect
    config:
      issuer: https://identity.gov.xx/.well-known/openid-configuration
      client_id: api-gateway-client
      client_secret: <secret>
      redirect_uri: https://api.gov.xx/auth/callback
      scopes:
        - openid
        - profile
        - email
      token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Use short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens valid for 7 days, rotate on use
- Require PKCE for mobile/SPA applications
- Implement token revocation endpoint

---

#### **2. API Keys (Service-to-Service)**

**Use Case:** Server-to-server integration, no user context

**Flow:**
```
Service → API Gateway (API Key in Header) → Validate Key
→ Check Rate Limits → Forward to Backend
```

**Kong Configuration:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - name: key-auth
    config:
      key_names:
        - apikey
      key_in_header: true
      key_in_query: false
      hide_credentials: true
```

**Best Practices:**
- Generate strong, random API keys (32+ characters)
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Scope keys to specific APIs (not global)
- Implement key revocation
- Never log API keys in plaintext

---

#### **3. Mutual TLS (mTLS) - High Security**

**Use Case:** High-security APIs (financial transactions, health records)

**Flow:**
```
Client → TLS Handshake with Client Certificate → API Gateway
→ Validate Certificate → Check Revocation → Forward to Backend
```

**Kong Configuration:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - name: mtls-auth
    config:
      ca_certificates:
        - <CA-cert-PEM>
      skip_consumer_lookup: false
      authenticated_group_by: CN
```

**Certificate Management:**
- Issue client certificates from trusted CA
- Implement certificate revocation (CRL or OCSP)
- Set certificate expiry (1-2 years)
- Automate certificate renewal

---

### **TLS 1.3 Configuration**

**Enforce TLS 1.3 Only:**
```nginx
# NGINX configuration (Kong uses NGINX)
ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384';
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_session_timeout 10m;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
```

**HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):**
```yaml
plugins:
  - name: response-transformer
    config:
      add:
        headers:
          - "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

---

### **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**

**Rate Limiting Tiers:**

| Tier | Requests/Minute | Requests/Day | Use Case |
|------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Free** | 60 | 5,000 | Public access, experimentation |
| **Standard** | 600 | 50,000 | Internal government services |
| **Premium** | 6,000 | 500,000 | High-volume production services |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Mission-critical, negotiated SLA |

**Kong Rate Limiting Configuration:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - name: rate-limiting
    config:
      minute: 60
      hour: 3600
      policy: local  # Or 'redis' for distributed rate limiting
      fault_tolerant: true
      hide_client_headers: false
```

**DDoS Protection Layers:**
1. **Network Layer (L3/L4):** AWS Shield, Cloudflare
2. **Application Layer (L7):** WAF rules (block malicious patterns)
3. **API Gateway:** Rate limiting, IP blacklisting, anomaly detection

## API Catalog Creation & Governance

### **API Categorization**

**Taxonomy:**

**By Function:**
- **Identity & Access:** Authentication, authorization, user profile
- **Financial:** Payments, invoices, tax records, subsidies
- **Business:** Company registration, licenses, permits
- **Health:** Patient records, vaccination, appointments
- **Transport:** Vehicle registration, driver licenses, traffic
- **Property:** Land registry, building permits
- **Social Services:** Benefits, pensions, welfare programs
- **Education:** Student records, scholarships, credentials
- **Justice:** Court records, legal documents, case status
- **Environment:** Permits, inspections, environmental data

**By Access Level:**
- **Public:** Open data, no authentication required (weather, public records)
- **Authenticated:** Requires API key or OAuth (most APIs)
- **Restricted:** High-security, mTLS or special approval (health, financial)
- **Internal:** Government agencies only (not exposed to public)

**By Maturity:**
- **Beta:** Early access, subject to breaking changes
- **Stable:** Production-ready, versioned, SLA applies
- **Deprecated:** Being phased out, migration path provided
- **Retired:** No longer available

---

### **API Lifecycle Management**

**Lifecycle Stages:**

```
Proposed → Designed → Development → Testing → Published → Deprecated → Retired
```

**Stage 1: Proposed**
- Agency submits API proposal to governance board
- Business case (why needed, expected usage, value)
- Preliminary data model
- Approval or rejection (with feedback)

**Stage 2: Designed**
- Detailed OpenAPI specification
- Security assessment
- Privacy impact assessment (if personal data)
- Design review by governance board or tech reviewers
- Approval to proceed

**Stage 3: Development**
- Implement API (backend logic, database, integration)
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Write tests (unit, integration, performance)
- Deploy to dev environment

**Stage 4: Testing**
- Functional testing (all endpoints work)
- Performance testing (load testing, latency)
- Security testing (pen test, vulnerability scan)
- Documentation review (completeness, accuracy)
- Beta testing with select developers
- Approval for production

**Stage 5: Published**
- Deploy to production
- Publish to API catalog
- Announce to developer community
- Monitor usage and feedback
- Continuous improvement (based on feedback)

**Stage 6: Deprecated**
- Announce deprecation (min 12 months before retirement)
- Provide migration guide (to new version or alternative API)
- Continue supporting (honor SLA) during deprecation period
- Warn developers on every call (response header)

**Stage 7: Retired**
- API no longer available
- Return 410 Gone status
- Redirect to migration guide
- Archive documentation for historical reference

---

### **API Versioning Strategy**

**Semantic Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes (incompatible with previous version)
- **MINOR:** New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Versioning in URL:**
```
https://api.gov.xx/business-registry/v1/businesses/{id}
https://api.gov.xx/business-registry/v2/businesses/{id}
```

**Version Support Policy:**
- Support N and N-1 versions concurrently (e.g., v2 and v1)
- Deprecate N-2 after 12 months notice
- Retire N-2 after 18-24 months (total lifecycle: 30-36 months per version)

**Breaking Change Examples:**
- Removing an endpoint
- Removing a field from response
- Changing data type (string → integer)
- Renaming field
- Changing authentication method

**Non-Breaking Change Examples:**
- Adding new endpoint
- Adding new optional field to request
- Adding new field to response (consumers should ignore unknown fields)
- Bug fixes

---

- Error rate >10% for 5 minutes
- Latency p95 >5 seconds for 5 minutes
- Database connection pool exhausted

**Warning Alerts (Notify during business hours):**
- Error rate >5% for 15 minutes
- Latency p95 >2 seconds for 15 minutes
- Cache hit rate <50% (performance degradation)
- Disk space >80% (on gateway nodes or database)

**Info Alerts (Log, investigate later):**
- New API published
- API deprecated
- Unusual traffic spike (100%+ increase in 1 hour)
- High quota consumption (developer nearing limit)

---

## Rate Limiting & SLA Policies

### **Rate Limiting Strategy**

**Why Rate Limiting?**
- Prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- Ensure fair usage (prevent one user from monopolizing resources)
- Protect backend services (from overload)
- Enable tiered service (premium users get higher limits)

**Rate Limiting Dimensions:**
1. **Per Developer:** Limit based on API key or OAuth client
2. **Per API:** Each API can have different limits (based on backend capacity)
3. **Global:** Total requests across all APIs (circuit breaker)

**Implementation:**
- **Algorithm:** Token bucket or leaky bucket
- **Storage:** Redis (distributed, shared across gateway nodes)
- **Response:** HTTP 429 Too Many Requests, with `Retry-After` header

**Example Kong Configuration:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - name: rate-limiting
    config:
      minute: 60
      hour: 3600
      policy: redis
      redis_host: redis.api.gov.xx
      redis_port: 6379
      fault_tolerant: true
      hide_client_headers: false
```

**Response Headers:**
```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Minute: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute: 42
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1678901234
```

---

### **SLA Tiers**

**Service Level Agreements by Tier:**

| Metric | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Best Effort |
|--------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Uptime** | 99.9% | 99.5% | 99% | No SLA |
| **Latency (p95)** | <200ms | <500ms | <1s | No SLA |
| **Error Rate** | <0.1% | <0.5% | <1% | No SLA |
| **Rate Limit (req/min)** | Custom | 600 | 60 | 10 |
| **Support Response** | <1 hour | <4 hours | <24 hours | Best effort |
| **Compensation** | Credits | Credits | None | None |

**SLA Measurement:**
- Measured monthly
- Excludes planned maintenance (announced 7+ days in advance)
- Excludes force majeure (natural disasters, etc.)

## Conclusion

API gateway deployment is a critical enabler of the GaaS framework, serving as the integration backbone for digital government. Success requires:

1. **Strategic Vision:** Clear articulation of why APIs matter, business value, and governance model
2. **Right Technology:** Select vendor/platform based on requirements, not hype
3. **Developer-Centric:** Treat developers (internal and external) as customers - great docs, support, and experience
4. **Security First:** Build security in from day one, not retrofitted later
5. **Start Small, Scale Fast:** Pilot with 5 high-value APIs, prove value, then scale aggressively
6. **Governance:** Establish clear standards, lifecycle management, and accountability
7. **Measure & Optimize:** Track KPIs, collect feedback, continuously improve

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Executive sponsorship (mandate for API-first)
- Adequate funding (don't underfund infrastructure)
- Talented team (API architects, developers, DevOps)
- Agency collaboration (can't force adoption, must demonstrate value)
- Developer advocacy (treat developers as community to nurture)

**Next Steps:**
1. Secure executive approval and budget
2. Hire core team (API Product Manager, Lead Architect, DevOps Lead)
3. Conduct current state assessment
4. Select technology vendor
5. Begin infrastructure setup while designing governance

**Remember:** APIs are not just a technical integration pattern - they are a product, and like any product, they need product management, marketing, support, and continuous improvement. Build your API program accordingly.
