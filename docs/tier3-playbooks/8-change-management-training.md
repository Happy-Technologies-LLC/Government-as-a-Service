## PPT Investment Breakdown

This playbook follows the People-Process-Technology (PPT) framework with dominant emphasis on people, reflecting the human-centered nature of change management.

**Investment Allocation:**
- **People (70%):** Change managers, trainers, champions network, communications specialists, organizational development
- **Process (20%):** Change methodologies, training curricula, communication plans, stakeholder engagement procedures
- **Technology (10%):** Learning management systems, collaboration tools, survey platforms, analytics

**Total Investment:** $150K-$5M (varies by organization size - typically 5-10% of digital transformation budget)

This allocation reflects that change management is fundamentally about people - understanding resistance, building skills, fostering culture change, and enabling adoption. Technology serves primarily as an enabler for training delivery and communication.

## GSM Framework Alignment

This playbook aligns with the **Government Service Management (GSM)** framework, specifically:
- **GSM Organizational Change Management Practice** - Government-specific change enablement and stakeholder engagement
- **GSM Workforce and Talent Management** - Skills development and capacity building for digital government
- **GSM Relationship Management** - Citizen and stakeholder engagement aligned with public value
- **GSM Continual Improvement** - Learning culture and continuous service enhancement

GSM replaces traditional change management frameworks with government-focused approaches emphasizing democratic participation, public service values, and whole-of-government collaboration.

## 6. Resistance Management

### 6.1 Common Resistance Patterns

#### **Pattern 1: Fear of Job Loss**

**Manifestation**:
- "Automation will replace us"
- "Why invest in training if I won't have a job?"
- Anxiety, low morale, spreading negativity

**Root Causes**:
- Previous layoffs or restructuring
- Media stories about AI/automation replacing workers
- Lack of clarity on future staffing plans

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Transparent Communication** (from executives)
   - Clear statement: "No layoffs planned due to this initiative"
   - Explanation: "Automation handles repetitive tasks; staff focus on complex, meaningful work"
   - Commitment: Put it in writing, communicate repeatedly

2. **Upskilling and Reskilling**
   - Offer training in new skills (data analysis, customer service excellence)
   - Create career paths: "Your role is evolving, here's how to grow"
   - Highlight examples: "Staff member X moved from data entry to process improvement analyst"

3. **Attrition and Redeployment**
   - If efficiencies do reduce need for staff, manage through attrition (don't backfill retirements)
   - Redeploy staff to higher-value work (e.g., proactive outreach, citizen engagement)

4. **Union Engagement** (if applicable)
   - Involve union early in planning
   - Negotiate commitments: Job security, training, redeployment
   - Collaborative approach: "We're in this together"

---

#### **Pattern 2: Skepticism About Benefits**

- "It won't actually make our jobs easier"

**Root Causes**:
- History of failed IT projects
- Over-promises and under-delivery
- Lack of trust in leadership

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Acknowledge the Past**
   - "We know previous initiatives didn't deliver. Here's what we're doing differently"
   - Admit mistakes, show lessons learned
   - Build credibility through honesty

2. **Demonstrate Quick Wins**
   - Pilot program: Let skeptics see results firsthand
   - Success stories: Share tangible examples from other organizations
   - Show, don't just tell: Live demonstrations, not PowerPoint

3. **Involve Skeptics**
   - Invite them to pilot program: "Try it and give us honest feedback"
   - Co-create solutions: "Help us design this so it actually works"
   - Convert critics to champions: Once they see it works, they become advocates

4. **Realistic Expectations**
   - Don't overpromise: "This won't solve every problem, but it will improve X, Y, Z"
   - Be honest about challenges: "Implementation will be bumpy; here's how we'll handle issues"
   - Incremental benefits: "We'll see improvements over time, not overnight"

#### **Pattern 3: Workload and Time Concerns**

**Manifestation**:
- "I don't have time for training"
- "This will just add to my workload"
- "I'm too busy with my real job to learn a new system"

**Root Causes**:
- Already overworked staff
- Training scheduled during peak work periods
- Lack of backfill or coverage

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Backfill and Coverage**
   - Hire temporary staff or reassign work during training
   - Reduce workload expectations: "You're not expected to maintain full productivity while in training"
   - Manager communication: "Your priority this week is training"

2. **Flexible Training Schedule**
   - Offer multiple session times (morning, afternoon, evening)
   - Self-paced e-learning (complete on your schedule)
   - Just-in-time training (close to go-live, not months in advance)

3. **Paid Training Time**
   - Training during work hours (not personal time)
   - Overtime pay if training is outside normal hours
   - Manager support: "This is part of your job, not extra"

4. **Workload Relief Post-Launch**
   - "Yes, it's extra work now, but once you're trained, the new system will save you 5-10 hours/week"
   - Demonstrate time savings: "You currently spend 2 hours/day on X; new system does it in 15 minutes"
   - Long-term benefit: "Short-term investment for long-term gain"

---

#### **Pattern 4: Technical Anxiety**

**Manifestation**:
- "I'm not tech-savvy"
- "What if I break something?"
- "I'll never learn this"

**Root Causes**:
- Low computer literacy (especially older staff)
- Fear of looking incompetent
- Previous negative experiences with technology

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Beginner-Friendly Training**
   - No assumptions: Start with basics (how to log in, use a mouse)
   - Patient instructors: Allow extra time, encourage questions
   - Small class sizes: 8-12 people max for hands-on attention

2. **Practice Environment**
   - Safe sandbox: "You can't break anything here; practice as much as you want"
   - Unlimited access: Practice at your own pace, outside of training
   - Remediation: Extra training sessions for those who need more time

3. **Buddy System**
   - Pair tech-anxious staff with tech-savvy peers
   - Peer mentoring: "Your buddy is here to help anytime you need"
   - Champions as tutors: Designated staff to answer questions

4. **Positive Reinforcement**
   - Celebrate small wins: "You successfully completed your first task!"
   - Build confidence incrementally: Start easy, gradually increase complexity
   - Normalize mistakes: "Everyone makes mistakes while learning; that's how we improve"

---

### 6.2 Root Cause Analysis

**Use the "5 Whys" technique to uncover root causes**:

**Example**:

**Presenting Issue**: "Staff aren't completing training"

1. **Why?** "They say they don't have time"
   2. **Why?** "They're too busy with their regular work"
      3. **Why?** "No one is covering their work while they're in training"
         4. **Why?** "Managers didn't budget for coverage"
            5. **Why?** "Training workload wasn't communicated clearly to managers"

**Root Cause**: Lack of manager communication and planning for training coverage

**Solution**:
- Send detailed communication to managers 6 weeks before training
- Provide budget for temporary coverage
- Reduce workload expectations during training period
- Hold managers accountable for staff completion rates

---

### 6.3 Escalation Procedures

**Level 1: Peer Intervention** (for mild resistance)
- Champions or peers have informal conversations
- Share success stories, answer questions
- Encourage participation

**Level 2: Manager Intervention** (for moderate resistance)
- Manager has one-on-one conversation
- Understand concerns, address root causes
- Set clear expectations for participation
- Follow up regularly

**Level 3: Change Manager Intervention** (for significant resistance)
- Change manager investigates root causes
- Tailored support plan (extra training, resources, mentoring)
- Regular check-ins and coaching
- Document progress

**Level 4: Executive Intervention** (for persistent resistance)
- Executive sponsor meets with resistor
- Reinforce strategic importance
- Offer final support and resources
- Set consequences for non-compliance

**Level 5: HR Disciplinary Action** (for disruptive resistance)
- Formal performance improvement plan
- Written warning
- Potential reassignment or termination (last resort)
- Document all actions for legal protection

**When to Escalate**:
- Level 1→2: After 2 weeks of gentle encouragement
- Level 2→3: After 2 manager conversations with no progress
- Level 3→4: If resistance is affecting team or project
- Level 4→5: If resistance is insubordination or disruptive

---

### 6.4 Success Stories to Counter Resistance

**Strategy**: Share real examples of successful transformations to build confidence

#### **Case Study 1: City of Boston**

**Context**: Implemented 311 digital service request system

**Initial Resistance**:
- Front-line staff feared job loss
- Skepticism about citizen adoption
- Concerns about system reliability

**How They Overcame**:
- **Job Security**: Mayor publicly committed to no layoffs; instead, staff focused on complex cases
- **Pilot Program**: Started with 2 departments, showed 60% increase in request volume (more work, not less)
- **Quick Wins**: Within 3 months, resolution time dropped 40%, citizen satisfaction up 25%

**Outcome**:
- 95% staff adoption within 6 months
- Staff reported feeling more productive and less stressed
- Many initial resistors became champions

**Lesson**: "Pilot programs and quick wins convert skeptics"

---

#### **Case Study 2: State of Utah**

**Context**: Modernized unemployment insurance system

**Initial Resistance**:
- Caseworkers (average age 55) anxious about learning new technology
- Union concerns about workload increase
- Fear that online services would overwhelm staff

**How They Overcame**:
- **Tailored Training**: Extra sessions for tech-anxious staff, buddy system, unlimited practice time
- **Union Partnership**: Involved union in design, guaranteed no layoffs, created career paths for upskilling
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased over 18 months (not "big bang"), allowed staff to adjust

**Outcome**:
- 98% staff completion of training
- Staff survey: 82% felt prepared, 75% felt the new system was easier
- Caseworkers now handle 30% more claims with same headcount (but less repetitive work)

**Lesson**: "Meet people where they are; provide extra support for those who need it"

---

#### **Case Study 3: County of San Diego**

**Context**: Unified permit and licensing platform

**Initial Resistance**:
- 12 different departments with unique processes; "our work is different" mindset
- Territorial department heads worried about losing control
- Front-line staff overwhelmed by change volume

**How They Overcame**:
- **Co-Creation**: Involved department heads and front-line staff in design; customized workflows for each department
- **Champions Network**: Recruited 50 champions across all departments; met monthly to share learnings
- **Change Fatigue Management**: Bundled all changes into one initiative (instead of 12 separate projects)

**Outcome**:
- All 12 departments live within 12 months
- Inter-department collaboration improved (data sharing, joint processing)
- Staff reported feeling heard and valued; 80% satisfaction with change process

**Lesson**: "Involve people in the solution; they'll own the outcome"

### 9.3 Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **In-House Content Development** (save 30-50%)
   - Train internal staff to use authoring tools (Articulate, Captivate)
   - Develop simple videos and guides in-house
   - Outsource only complex content

2. **Open-Source LMS** (save 50-80%)
   - Use Moodle (free) instead of commercial LMS
   - Hosting and support still required ($5K-15K/year)

3. **Peer Training** (save 20-40% on instructor costs)
   - Train-the-trainer: Upskill internal staff to deliver training
   - Champions as co-trainers
   - Reduces need for external trainers

4. **Virtual Training** (save 30-50% on logistics)
   - Conduct training via Zoom/Teams instead of in-person
   - Eliminates facility rental, catering, travel costs
   - Trade-off: Less hands-on, lower engagement

5. **Leverage Vendor Resources** (free)
   - Many software vendors provide free training materials, webinars, certifications
   - Customize vendor content instead of building from scratch

6. **Phased Rollout** (spread costs over time)
   - Train departments incrementally (not all at once)
   - Spreads budget over 12-18 months instead of 3-6 months
   - Allows learning from early phases to improve later phases

**Potential Savings**: 20-40% of total budget with strategic cost-saving measures

## Conclusion

Successful GaaS transformation depends as much on people as on technology. This playbook, aligned with Government Service Management (GSM) principles, provides a comprehensive framework for managing organizational change and delivering effective training that ensures your staff, citizens, and stakeholders are prepared, confident, and supportive.

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Stakeholder Engagement is Critical**: Tailor your approach to different stakeholder types (champions, supporters, neutral, resistors) and engage them early and often.

2. **Communication Must Be Continuous**: From 6 months before go-live to 6 months after, maintain transparent, multi-channel communication that builds awareness, understanding, and support.

3. **Training Must Be Role-Based**: One-size-fits-all training doesn't work. Executives, managers, front-line staff, IT staff, and citizens each need tailored learning experiences.

4. **Champions Multiply Your Impact**: A well-supported champions network (5-10% of staff) can influence the other 90-95%, accelerating adoption and reducing resistance.

5. **Measurement Drives Improvement**: Track completion rates, satisfaction, behavior change, and culture shift. Use data to continuously improve your approach.

6. **Invest Appropriately**: Budget $150K-$5M (depending on organization size) for change management and training. The ROI is 2-5x within 2-3 years through efficiency gains, reduced errors, and higher retention.

**Next Steps**:

1. Appoint a Change Manager to lead this effort
2. Assemble your change team and champions network
3. Adapt this playbook to your organization's context
4. Begin planning 6 months before your go-live date
5. Execute the plan with discipline and flexibility

With comprehensive change management and training, your GaaS transformation will not only deliver technological modernization—it will build a culture of continuous improvement, citizen-centricity, and digital excellence.
