# Tier 3 Implementation Playbook #6: Cybersecurity Operations

## PPT Investment Breakdown

This playbook follows the People-Process-Technology (PPT) framework with process-heavy emphasis reflecting the operational nature of cybersecurity.

**Investment Allocation:**
- **People (35%):** $7-17.5M setup + $3.5-7M annual - SOC analysts, threat hunters, incident responders, security engineers
- **Process (40%):** $8-20M setup + $4-8M annual - Incident response playbooks, threat intelligence, compliance frameworks, security policies
- **Technology (25%):** $5-12.5M setup + $2.5-5M annual - SIEM, EDR/XDR, SOAR, threat intel platforms

**Total Investment:** $20-50M (setup) + $10-20M annually (operations)

This allocation reflects the process-intensive nature of security operations, where incident response procedures, threat analysis, and compliance management consume significant effort. People investment is also substantial given the need for highly skilled security analysts operating 24/7.

## GSM Framework Alignment

This playbook aligns with the **Government Service Management (GSM)** framework, specifically:
- **GSM Incident Management Practice** - Adapted for cyber incidents with citizen impact transparency
- **GSM Problem Management Practice** - Root cause analysis and vulnerability remediation
- **GSM Service Continuity Practice** - Resilience and disaster recovery for critical services
- **GSM Information Security Management** - Government-specific security controls and risk frameworks

GSM replaces traditional ITIL practices with government-focused approaches emphasizing citizen rights, democratic accountability, and public value protection.

## SOC Establishment Guide

### **Build vs. Managed Service Decision**

**Build In-House SOC:**

**Pros:**
- Full control over operations and data
- Build internal capability (knowledge stays)
- Customized to government needs
- Data sovereignty (no third-party access)

**Cons:**
- High upfront cost ($20-50M)
- Difficult to hire/retain talent (compete with private sector)
- 24/7 staffing challenging (need 15-20 analysts minimum)
- Technology refresh burden

**Best For:** Large countries (>20M population), high security requirements, adequate budget

---

**Managed SOC (Outsource):**

**Pros:**
- Lower upfront cost (pay-as-you-go)
- Immediate expertise (vendor has experienced analysts)
- 24/7 coverage easier (vendor's problem)
- Technology included (SIEM, threat intel, tools)

**Cons:**
- Less control (vendor makes decisions)
- Data sharing concerns (logs sent to vendor)
- Vendor lock-in
- May not understand government context

**Best For:** Small countries (<5M), budget constraints, fast deployment needed

---

**Hybrid Model (Recommended):**

**Approach:**
- Build Tier 1 SOC in-house (monitoring, basic triage)
- Outsource Tier 2/3 (advanced analysis, threat hunting) to managed service

---

### **Playbook 1: Ransomware Attack**

**Trigger:** EDR detects ransomware (file encryption) OR user reports locked files

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Steps:**

**1. Containment (Immediate - within 5 minutes):**
- [ ] Isolate infected endpoint from network (via EDR or network quarantine)
- [ ] Disable user account (prevent attacker using credentials)
- [ ] Block C2 IPs/domains at firewall (from threat intel)
- [ ] Alert SOC manager and CISO (via automated SOAR workflow)

**2. Investigation (Within 30 minutes):**
- [ ] Identify ransomware variant (hash, behavior)
- [ ] Determine patient zero (how did it get in? Email? Web? RDP?)
- [ ] Map spread (which other systems infected? Use EDR telemetry)
- [ ] Check backups (are they intact? encrypted too?)

**3. Eradication (Within 2 hours):**
- [ ] Image infected systems for forensics
- [ ] Wipe and rebuild infected systems (from gold image)
- [ ] Patch vulnerability that allowed entry
- [ ] Remove attacker persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks, registry keys)

**4. Recovery (Within 24 hours):**
- [ ] Restore data from backups (test restore first)
- [ ] Bring systems back online (one at a time, monitor)
- [ ] Reset all passwords (assume credentials compromised)
- [ ] Validate no reinfection (monitor 48 hours)

**5. Post-Incident (Within 1 week):**
- [ ] Root cause analysis (how did this happen?)
- [ ] Update defenses (block attack vectors)
- [ ] Report to authorities (law enforcement, data protection if PII exposed)
- [ ] Communicate to stakeholders (exec, public if major incident)
- [ ] Lessons learned meeting (what did we learn? what will we change?)

**DO NOT:**
- Pay ransom (funds terrorism, no guarantee of decryption, legal issues)
- Negotiate with attackers (waste of time, gives them leverage)
- Delete evidence (preserve for law enforcement and forensics)

---

### **Playbook 2: Phishing Campaign**

**Trigger:** Multiple users report suspicious emails OR email security gateway detects campaign

**Severity:** HIGH

**Steps:**

**1. Containment (Within 15 minutes):**
- [ ] Block sender domain/email in email gateway
- [ ] Delete emails from all mailboxes (admin purge)
- [ ] Block malicious URLs in web proxy
- [ ] Alert all users (via email, intranet banner): "Phishing campaign active, delete emails from [sender]"

**2. Investigation (Within 1 hour):**
- [ ] Analyze email (headers, links, attachments)
- [ ] Identify users who clicked link or opened attachment (email logs, web proxy logs)
- [ ] Scan clicked users' devices (EDR sweep for malware)
- [ ] Check for compromised credentials (did users enter passwords on phishing site?)

**3. Remediation:**
- [ ] Reset passwords for users who entered credentials
- [ ] Isolate and clean infected devices (if malware found)
- [ ] Retrain users (send reminder on phishing indicators)

**4. Prevention:**
- [ ] Update email filters (add patterns from this campaign)
- [ ] Conduct organization-wide phishing test (see who still falls for it)
- [ ] Schedule security awareness training for high-risk users

---

### **Playbook 3: Data Breach (Unauthorized Access)**

**Severity:** CRITICAL (if PII or classified data), HIGH otherwise

**Steps:**

**1. Containment (Immediate):**
- [ ] Disable compromised accounts
- [ ] Block attacker IPs
- [ ] Isolate affected systems
- [ ] Preserve logs and evidence

**2. Investigation (Within 4 hours):**
- [ ] Determine scope: What data was accessed? How much? When?
- [ ] Identify breach method: Stolen credentials? SQL injection? Insider?
- [ ] Map attacker activity: What did they do? What systems touched?

**3. Notification (Within 72 hours - legal requirement in many jurisdictions):**
- [ ] Notify Data Protection Authority (if PII/personal data)
- [ ] Notify affected individuals (if high risk to them)
- [ ] Notify law enforcement
- [ ] Public disclosure (if legally required or major incident)

**4. Remediation:**
- [ ] Close vulnerability that allowed breach
- [ ] Remove attacker access (kill sessions, rotate keys)

## Tabletop Exercise Scenarios

### **Exercise 1: APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Attack**

**Scenario:** Nation-state actor has been in your network for 3 months (discovered by threat intel tip). They have exfiltrated documents from foreign ministry.

**Objectives:**
- Test incident command structure
- Test cross-agency coordination (IT, legal, PR, diplomacy)
- Test decision-making under pressure

**Inject Timeline:**

**T+0 (Discovery):** Threat intel partner alerts you: "We've seen your foreign ministry documents for sale on dark web."

**T+30 min:** Your investigation confirms breach. Attacker still has access (C2 beacons active).

**T+1 hour:** Legal wants to preserve evidence for prosecution. IT wants to shut down attacker access immediately. Conflict.

**T+2 hours:** Media inquires (leak?). How do you respond?

**T+4 hours:** Diplomat asks: "Were my emails stolen? I negotiated sensitive treaty." How do you assess?

**T+6 hours:** Foreign ministry demands: "Shut down email until secure." But this paralyzes operations. What do you do?

**Debrief Questions:**
- Who made decisions? Was authority clear?
- How long to contain? (Target: <4 hours from discovery to containment)
- Communication effective? (internal and external)
- What would you do differently?

---

### **Exercise 2: Supply Chain Compromise**

**Scenario:** Popular government software (used by 20+ agencies) is compromised by attacker. Update pushed to all agencies contains backdoor.

**Objectives:**
- Test detection capabilities (would we catch this?)
- Test inter-agency coordination
- Test decision under uncertainty (shut down software? but it's critical for operations)

**Inject Timeline:**

**T+0:** Security researcher tweets: "[Software name] may be compromised. Investigating."

**T+30 min:** Vendor confirms: "We were breached. Attackers may have tampered with update 4 months ago."

**T+1 hour:** You discover 18 agencies installed compromised update.

**T+2 hours:** You don't know yet what the backdoor does. Could be espionage, could be ransomware on a trigger.

**Decision Point:** Do you shut down the software immediately (paralyzes 18 agencies) or keep running while investigating?

**T+4 hours:** Analysis confirms backdoor allows remote code execution. Now what?

**Debrief:**
- How quickly did we detect? (Ideal: before vendor announced, via EDR or NDR)
- Communication to affected agencies effective?
- Decision-making process: Who decides to shut down cross-agency software?
- Prevention: How do we vet software updates better?

## Supply Chain Security Verification

### **Vendor Risk Assessment**

**For All Technology Vendors:**

**Step 1: Initial Screening**
- [ ] Vendor background check (financial stability, reputation)
- [ ] Data protection policy review (GDPR/local law compliance)
- [ ] Security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, others)
- [ ] References (2-3 government customers)

**Step 2: Security Questionnaire (80+ questions)**

**Sample Questions:**
- How do you protect customer data at rest and in transit?
- Where are data centers located? (data sovereignty)
- Do you have a SOC 2 Type II report? (can we review?)
- What is your incident response process?
- How do you manage vulnerabilities? (patching SLA?)
- Do you conduct penetration testing? (how often? by whom?)
- What is your employee background check policy?
- Do you allow security audits by customers? (right to audit)

**Step 3: Contract Security Terms**
- Data residency requirements (no cross-border transfer without approval)
- Security incident notification (within 24 hours)
- Right to audit (annually or triggered by incident)
- Breach liability (vendor responsible for damages)
- Data deletion upon contract termination

**Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring**
- Annual security review (re-questionnaire)
- Monitor for vendor breaches (threat intel feeds)
- Test vendor security (penetration test interfaces if allowed)

---

### **Software Supply Chain Security**

**For All Software (Commercial, Open Source):**

**1. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**
- Require vendors to provide SBOM (list of all components and dependencies)
- Scan SBOM for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Tool: OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Black Duck

**2. Code Signing Verification:**
- All software updates must be digitally signed
- Verify signature before installing (prevents tampering)
- Reject unsigned or invalid signatures

**3. Isolated Testing:**
- Never install updates directly to production
- Test in sandbox/staging environment first
- Monitor for malicious behavior (unexpected network connections, file changes)

**4. Update Delay Policy:**
- For critical software, delay updates 7 days after release (let others be guinea pigs)
- Monitor for reports of issues or compromises
- Emergency patch exception (if addressing actively exploited vulnerability)

**5. Alternative Vendors:**
- Avoid single points of failure (have alternative vendor for critical software)
- Can switch if primary vendor compromised or goes out of business

- **Talented Team:** Hire and retain skilled analysts (compete on mission, not just money)
- **Right Tools:** Modern SIEM, EDR, threat intel (don't cheap out)
- **Continuous Improvement:** Learn from every incident, update defenses
- **Collaboration:** Share threat intel with other governments and sectors

**Next Steps:**
1. Decide: Build, buy, or hybrid SOC?
2. Hire SOC Manager and core team
3. Deploy SIEM and EDR (critical infrastructure first)
4. Develop playbooks and train team
5. Achieve initial operating capability (8am-8pm monitoring)
6. Scale to 24/7 over 6 months
7. Mature: Add SOAR, threat hunting, red team

**Remember:** Cybersecurity is a race. Attackers improve constantly. Your defenses must too. Invest in your SOC - it's the last line of defense between attackers and citizen data.
