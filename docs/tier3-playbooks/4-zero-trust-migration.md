## NIST 800-207 Compliance Checklist

### **Core Zero Trust Tenets (from NIST SP 800-207)**

**Tenet 1: All data sources and computing services are considered resources**
- [ ] Inventory all resources (applications, data stores, APIs, devices)
- [ ] Apply consistent security controls regardless of location (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)
- [ ] Treat internal resources with same scrutiny as external

**Tenet 2: All communication is secured regardless of network location**
- [ ] Encrypt all traffic (TLS 1.3 for data in transit)
- [ ] Do not assume internal network is safe (encrypt internal traffic too)
- [ ] Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication

**Tenet 3: Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis**
- [ ] No permanent access (re-authenticate periodically)
- [ ] Continuous verification during session (not just at login)
- [ ] Session timeouts enforced (idle timeout, absolute timeout)

**Tenet 4: Access is determined by dynamic policy (identity, device, behavior, etc.)**
- [ ] Policy engine evaluates multiple signals (not just username/password)
- [ ] Contextual factors considered: device health, location, time, behavior
- [ ] Risk-based decisions (step-up authentication for high-risk actions)

**Tenet 5: Enterprise monitors and measures integrity and security posture of all assets**
- [ ] Continuous device health monitoring (patching, encryption, compliance)
- [ ] Asset inventory always current (automated discovery)
- [ ] Behavioral analytics (detect anomalies)

**Tenet 6: All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced**
- [ ] No implicit trust (being on VPN doesn't grant access)
- [ ] Least privilege access (minimum necessary for task)
- [ ] Just-in-time (JIT) access (elevated privileges granted only when needed, expire after use)

**Tenet 7: Enterprise collects as much information as possible about current state, uses it to improve security**
- [ ] Log everything (authentication, access, changes, errors)
- [ ] Analyze logs for threats and improvements
- [ ] Feed learnings back into policy (adaptive security)

---

**Threat Hunting:**
- Proactive search for threats (not just waiting for alerts)
- SOC analysts hunt for indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Hypothesis-driven (e.g., "Are there any long-dormant accounts suddenly active?")
- Tools: SIEM, EDR, threat intelligence

**Metrics Dashboard:**
- Track KPIs (see Metrics section below)

## Configuration & Deployment Procedures

### **Identity Provider (IdP) Configuration**

**Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) Example:**

**Step 1: Tenant Setup**
```
- Create Azure AD tenant (if not exists)
- Configure custom domain (identity.gov.xx)
- Enable Azure AD Premium P2 (required for advanced features)
```

**Step 2: Conditional Access Policies**
```
Policy 1: Require MFA for All Users
- Users: All users
- Cloud apps: All cloud apps
- Conditions: Any location, any device
- Access controls: Require MFA
- Session: Sign-in frequency 8 hours

Policy 2: Block Legacy Authentication
- Users: All users
- Cloud apps: All cloud apps
- Conditions: Client apps = Exchange ActiveSync, Other clients
- Access controls: Block
- Rationale: Legacy auth doesn't support MFA (security risk)

Policy 3: Require Compliant Device for Sensitive Apps
- Users: All users
- Cloud apps: Finance app, HR app, Email
- Conditions: Any location
- Access controls: Require device to be marked compliant (via Intune)
- Rationale: Prevent access from compromised/unmanaged devices

Policy 4: Require Privileged Access Workstation for Admin
- Users: Global admins, security admins
- Cloud apps: Azure portal, M365 admin center
- Conditions: Any location
- Access controls: Require hybrid Azure AD joined device + MFA
- Rationale: Admins are high-value targets, need strongest controls
```

**Step 3: Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**
```
- Enable PIM for all admin roles
- Configure:
  - Activation duration: 4 hours (max, auto-expire)
  - Require justification on activation (why do you need admin access now?)
  - Require approval (by another admin)
  - MFA on activation (even if already authenticated)
- Audit: Monthly review of who activated what, when
```

**Step 4: Identity Protection**
```
- Enable Azure AD Identity Protection
- Policies:
  - High risk user: Require password change + MFA
  - High risk sign-in: Block or require MFA
- Risk detection signals:
  - Anonymous IP, atypical travel, malware-linked IP, leaked credentials
```

```
- Network containment: Isolate host if critical threat detected (auto)
- File quarantine: Quarantine malicious files (auto)
- Alert SOC: Send alert to SIEM for human review (auto)
- Script remediation: Auto-run scripts to kill malicious processes, delete files
```

**Step 4: Monitoring & Tuning**
```
- Week 1-2: Monitor mode (log detections, don't block) - identify false positives
- Week 3: Tune policies (whitelist known-good apps causing false positives)
- Week 4+: Enforcement mode (block threats automatically)
- Ongoing: Monthly review of detections, tune as needed
```

### **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) Deployment**

**Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) Example:**

**Architecture:**
```
User Device → Zscaler Cloud → ZPA Connector (in datacenter) → Application
- No VPN, no broad network access
- Application-level access (user can access HR app, not entire HR network)
```

**Step 1: ZPA Tenant Setup**
```
- Provision Zscaler ZPA tenant
- Configure IdP integration (Azure AD SAML)
- Define user groups (sync from Azure AD)
```

**Step 2: Deploy ZPA Connectors**
```
- Install lightweight connector on VM in datacenter (near applications)
- Connector establishes outbound connection to Zscaler cloud (no inbound firewall rules needed)
- HA: Deploy 2+ connectors per datacenter (auto-failover)
```

**Step 3: Publish Applications**
```
Application: HR Portal
- Internal URL: https://hr-portal.internal.gov.xx
- ZPA URL: https://hr.zpa.gov.xx (via Zscaler)
- Access policy:
  - Who: HR staff group (from Azure AD)
  - When: Business hours (8am-6pm, Mon-Fri)
  - What device: Compliant devices only (MDM-managed, up-to-date)
  - From where: Any location (cloud-first, work from anywhere)
- MFA: Required (enforced by Azure AD Conditional Access)
```

**Step 4: User Onboarding**
```
- Install Zscaler Client Connector on user devices (via MDM or self-service)
- User logs in with Azure AD credentials + MFA
- Client automatically routes traffic to ZPA apps through Zscaler cloud
- No VPN client needed
```

**Step 5: Migrate from VPN**
```
- Week 1-4: Pilot (50 users, 5 apps)
- Week 5-12: Scale (500 users, 20 apps)
- Week 13-24: Full migration (all users, all apps)
- Week 25: Decommission VPN (celebrate!)
```

### **Sample Training Content: MFA for End Users**

**Slide 1: Why MFA?**
- Passwords alone are weak (90% of breaches involve stolen passwords)
- MFA adds second factor (something you have: phone, token)
- Even if password stolen, attacker can't access without your phone

**Slide 2: How MFA Works**
- Step 1: Enter username and password (something you know)
- Step 2: Approve notification on phone or enter code (something you have)
- Step 3: Access granted

**Slide 3: Setting Up MFA**
- Video walkthrough (2 minutes): Install authenticator app, scan QR code, test
- Job aid: Step-by-step screenshots

**Slide 4: Daily Use**
- First login of day: Approve notification on phone
- Trust this device (optional): Less frequent prompts on trusted devices
- Working remotely: Same process (MFA works anywhere)

**Slide 5: Troubleshooting**
- Lost phone? Contact IT help desk (backup codes or admin reset)
- App not working? Re-sync time on phone, reinstall app
- Still stuck? Help desk available 24/7

**Slide 6: Security Tips**
- Don't approve MFA prompts you didn't initiate (could be attacker)
- Keep phone secure (PIN/biometric lock)
- Report suspicious activity (IT will never ask for your MFA code)

## Conclusion

Zero Trust Architecture is not a product - it's a paradigm shift. Success requires cultural change (questioning implicit trust), technology investment, and continuous vigilance.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Executive Sponsorship:** CISO and executive leadership drive adoption
- **Phased Approach:** Don't attempt big-bang migration (too risky)
- **User Experience:** ZTA should be transparent to users (or better than VPN)
- **Metrics-Driven:** Track progress, prove value (security + business metrics)
- **Continuous Improvement:** ZTA is never "done" - always evolving threat landscape

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct current state assessment (use template in this playbook)
2. Secure budget and executive approval
3. Hire/train core team (security architects, engineers)
4. Begin Phase 1 (MFA, IAM, EDR) - quick wins
5. Pilot ZTNA with small user group
6. Iterate and scale based on lessons learned

**Remember:** Zero Trust is a journey, not a destination. Start today, improve continuously, and stay vigilant. The adversaries never rest - neither should our defenses.
