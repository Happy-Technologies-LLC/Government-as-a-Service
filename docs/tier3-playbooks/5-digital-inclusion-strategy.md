# Tier 3 Implementation Playbook #5: Digital Inclusion Strategy

## PPT Investment Breakdown

This playbook follows the People-Process-Technology (PPT) framework with predominant focus on people, reflecting the human-centered mission of digital inclusion.

**Investment Allocation:**
- **People (60%):** $9-24M - Digital champions, trainers, outreach workers, accessibility specialists, community partnerships
- **Process (30%):** $4.5-12M - Inclusion policies, accessibility standards, multi-channel service design, measurement frameworks
- **Technology (10%):** $1.5-4M - Assistive tech, accessible platforms, digital literacy tools, connectivity infrastructure

**Total Investment:** $15-40M over 3 years

This allocation reflects that digital inclusion is fundamentally about people - those who need support, those who provide it, and the community partnerships that enable it. Technology is the smallest component because the challenge is not technological but human and organizational.

### **Common Accessibility Issues & Fixes**

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Missing alt text on images** | Screen readers can't describe images | Add descriptive alt text to all `<img>` tags |
| **Low color contrast** | Hard to read for low vision users | Increase contrast ratio to 4.5:1 min (normal text), 3:1 (large text) |
| **Keyboard trap** | Keyboard users stuck in modal or menu | Ensure ESC key exits, Tab can navigate out |
| **No focus indicator** | Keyboard users don't know where they are | Add visible outline to focused elements (:focus CSS) |
| **Form labels missing** | Screen readers don't announce what field is | Associate `<label>` with `<input>` (for attribute) |
| **Video without captions** | Deaf/hard of hearing can't access content | Add closed captions (SRT file or YouTube auto-caption + review) |
| **PDF not tagged** | Screen readers can't parse structure | Tag PDF (headings, lists, tables) in Adobe Acrobat or export from accessible source |
| **Time limits too short** | Users with cognitive disabilities can't complete | Allow time extension or remove time limits for critical tasks |
| **Color-only indicators** | Color-blind users miss information | Add icon or text label in addition to color (e.g., red error + "Error:" text + X icon) |
| **Flashing content** | Can trigger seizures | Avoid flashing >3 times per second, or provide warning + skip option |

**Eligibility:**
- Household income <poverty line + 50%
- OR receiving government assistance (unemployment, food aid, housing subsidy)

**Subsidy:**
- Option 1: Voucher for 50-75% off device (use at participating retailers)
- Option 2: Free refurbished device (donated by corporations, refurbished by social enterprise)

**Device Specs (Minimum):**
- Smartphone: Android 10+ or iOS 14+, 32GB storage, front camera (for digital ID)
- Tablet: 10-inch screen, WiFi, 32GB storage (for seniors, easier to see/use)

**Distribution:**
- Apply online or at service centers
- Proof of income/eligibility required
- Collect device at designated pickup points or mail delivery

**Sustainability:**
- Corporate sponsorship (tax deduction for donations)
- Telecom partnerships (subsidize device, lock to network for 12 months)
- Government budget (allocate $10-20M annually, reach 100K-200K households)

---

### **Connectivity Programs**

**Rural Broadband Expansion**
- **Problem:** 30%+ of rural areas lack broadband (too expensive for ISPs to serve low-density areas)
- **Solution:**
  - **Subsidize ISPs:** Government co-invests in infrastructure (fiber, towers) in exchange for coverage commitment
  - **Public WiFi:** Deploy WiFi hotspots in community centers, libraries, post offices (free access)
  - **Satellite:** Subsidize satellite internet (Starlink, OneWeb) for remote areas

**Mobile Data Subsidies**
- **Problem:** Low-income households can't afford data plans
- **Solution:**
  - **Zero-Rating:** Government negotiates with telecoms to zero-rate government websites (access doesn't count toward data cap)
  - **Free Data Vouchers:** Provide vouchers for 1-2 GB/month data to low-income households
  - **Public WiFi:** See above

**Community Digital Hubs**
- **Problem:** Some households will never have home internet (cost, transient population)
- **Solution:** Create community digital hubs (libraries, post offices, community centers)
  - Free computers and tablets
  - Free WiFi
  - Staff to assist with digital tasks
  - Training workshops
  - Extended hours (evenings, weekends)
- **Target:** 1 hub per 20,000 population, focus on underserved areas

---

## Multi-Channel Service Design

### **Channel Strategy**

**Principle:** Digital-first, but never digital-only

**Channel Mix:**
1. **Digital (Online, Mobile App):** Primary channel, lowest cost, 24/7 availability
2. **Phone:** Secondary channel, for assistance, complex cases, elderly
3. **In-Person:** Tertiary channel, for those who can't/won't use digital, complex cases requiring judgment

**Service Design for Each Channel:**

---

**Digital (Online/Mobile App):**
- **Design:** User-friendly, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, mobile-first
- **Self-Service:** 80%+ of tasks completable without human assistance
- **Help:** Contextual help (tooltips, FAQs, chatbot), escalate to phone/chat if needed
- **Hours:** 24/7/365
- **Languages:** All official languages + major minority languages

---

**Phone:**
- **Number:** Single national number (e.g., 311 in US, 111 in UK)
- **Hours:** 8am-8pm weekdays, 10am-4pm weekends (consider 24/7 for critical services)
- **IVR (Interactive Voice Response):** Simple menu, option to speak to agent immediately (don't make users navigate complex phone tree)
- **Staffing:** 500+ agents (for 10M population), scale based on call volume
- **Training:** Agents trained on digital service (can walk users through online process while on call - "digital assist")
- **Languages:** All official languages (live agents or interpretation service)
- **Quality:** Monitor calls (random sampling), user satisfaction survey after call

**Phone Channel Use Cases:**
- Digital assistance ("I'm on the website but stuck at step 3, can you help?")
- Complex cases (requires judgment, not simple form-filling)
- Elderly/disabled who prefer voice
- Complaint handling

---

**In-Person (Service Centers):**
- **Locations:** Maintain physical service centers (reduce number over time as digital adoption grows, but never close all)
- **Hours:** 9am-5pm weekdays, limited hours Saturdays (consider needs of working population)
- **Queueing:** Appointment system (book online or by phone, reduces wait times) + walk-in (for urgent cases)
- **Staffing:** Trained agents with access to all systems (can complete any service on behalf of citizen)
- **Accessibility:** Wheelchair accessible, hearing loops, large-print materials, interpretation services available
- **Co-location:** Co-locate services (e.g., DMV, social services, health - one-stop shop)

**In-Person Use Cases:**
- Identity proofing (for digital ID enrollment - requires in-person biometric capture)
- Complex cases requiring document review
- Elderly/disabled who prefer/require in-person
- Citizens with low trust in digital (cultural, past negative experience)
- Legal requirements (some processes legally require in-person, e.g., oath for citizenship)

---

### **Channel Transition Strategy**

**Objective:** Gradually shift from in-person to digital (cost savings, efficiency), but maintain in-person for those who need it

**Tactics:**

**1. Nudge to Digital (Gentle Encouragement):**
- When citizen calls or visits in-person, ask: "Have you tried our online service? I can help you set up an account now."
- Offer tablet at service center (agent walks through digital process with citizen - "see, it's easy!")
- Follow-up email/SMS after in-person visit: "Next time, try online at [URL]"

**2. Incentivize Digital:**
- Faster processing (digital submissions processed within 24 hours, in-person may take 3-5 days)
- Lower fees (small discount for online payment - cost savings passed to user)
- Convenience messaging ("No travel, no wait, complete from home")

**3. Assisted Digital (Bridge):**
- Staff at service centers help citizens complete digital service (on tablet or kiosk)
- Phone agents walk through digital process (screen share via web chat)
- Volunteers (digital champions) in community help neighbors

**4. Maintain In-Person (Don't Force):**
- Never close all service centers (always maintain in-person option, especially in rural areas)
- For critical services (healthcare, social benefits), in-person must remain available (ethics and law)
- Measure and report: "% of population within 30 min travel of service center" - target 95%+

---

---

### **Assisted Digital Service**

**What is Assisted Digital?**
- Help for citizens who cannot use digital service independently (but could with assistance)
- **Not:** Doing it for them (they do it, we guide)
- **Goal:** Build capability, so they can do it independently next time

**Delivery Models:**

**1. Government Staff (Phone/In-Person):**
- Agents walk through digital process step-by-step
- Screen share via web chat (agent can see user's screen, guide them)
- In-person at service center (agent and citizen sit together, citizen uses tablet with agent's help)

**2. Volunteer Network (Community-Based):**
- Recruit volunteers (e.g., university students, retired government workers, community leaders)
- Train on digital services and teaching techniques
- Place in community centers, libraries
- Citizen can drop in for help (free, friendly, local)

**3. Family/Friend Proxy:**
- Allow trusted person (family member, caregiver) to complete service on behalf of citizen (with consent)
- Legal framework: Power of attorney or simple consent form
- Use case: Elderly parent authorizes adult child to manage benefits, disabled person authorizes caregiver

**4. Commercial Assistance:**
- Certify private sector (accountants, lawyers, notaries) to assist with government services
- They charge fee (market rate), but citizen has choice (government-provided assistance is free)
- Use case: Complex business registration, tax filing

## Case Studies

### **Case Study: Denmark - Digital Inclusion Excellence**

**Context:**
- 95%+ digital service usage (highest globally)
- But 5% cannot/will not use digital (elderly, disabled, digital refusers)
- Law requires digital-first, but with exemptions

**Approach:**

**1. Mandatory Digital Post (2014):**
- All government communication via secure digital mailbox (e-Boks)
- **Exemption:** Citizens can opt-out if:
  - Over 65 and request exemption (no questions asked)
  - Disability that prevents digital use (documented)
  - Lack of digital access (rare, but allowed)
- **Result:** 90%+ use digital mailbox, 10% receive paper (respected choice)

**2. Assisted Digital ("Digital ambassadors"):**
- Volunteers in libraries and community centers
- 500+ ambassadors nationwide
- Free drop-in help with digital services
- **Result:** 50,000+ citizens assisted annually

**3. Multi-Channel Guarantee:**
- Law requires all services available by phone and in-person (not digital-only)
- In-person service centers maintained in every municipality
- **Result:** No one excluded, even if prefer/require non-digital

**4. Trust and Transparency:**
- Digital ID (NemID/MitID) trusted by 95%+ (years of building trust)
- Privacy protections strong (GDPR gold standard)
- Transparency: "Here's what data we have about you" (online dashboard)

**Lessons:**
- Mandatory digital works IF exemptions provided (don't force vulnerable populations)
- Assisted digital critical (bridge for willing but unable)
- Multi-channel legally protected (inclusion by design, not afterthought)
- Trust takes time (invest in security, privacy, transparency)

### **Case Study: UK - Assisted Digital and Inclusion**

**Context:**
- "Digital by default" policy (2012) - push to digital services
- 20%+ of population lacked digital access or skills (2012)
- Risk of excluding millions

**Approach:**

**1. Assisted Digital Service Standard:**
- All government services must provide assisted digital (not optional)
- Two types:
  - **Digital Assist:** Help citizen complete digital service (phone, in-person, volunteer)
  - **Non-Digital Route:** Entirely offline option (phone, paper, in-person)
- **Funding:** Services budget for assisted digital (2-5% of total service cost)

**2. Digital Inclusion Strategy:**
- Partner with charities (Age UK, AbilityNet, Citizens Advice)
- Fund digital skills training programs
- Provide devices (refurbished laptops/tablets to low-income households)
- Free WiFi in public libraries (extended hours)

**3. Accessibility First:**
- GDS (Government Digital Service) sets accessibility standard (WCAG 2.1 AA mandatory)
- Services cannot launch without passing accessibility audit
- Publish accessibility statement on all services

**Results:**
- Digital service usage: 82% (2020, up from 60% in 2012)
- 9M+ citizens received digital skills training (2012-2020)
- Accessibility compliance: 95%+ of services pass WCAG 2.1 AA
- Inclusion: <5% report inability to access government services

**Lessons:**
- Assisted digital as requirement, not optional (budget for it)
- Partnerships scale faster (leverage existing charities, don't build from scratch)
- Accessibility non-negotiable (mandate + audit)
- Measure and report (transparency drives accountability)

## Conclusion

Digital inclusion is not charity - it's justice. In a world where government services go digital, exclusion means denial of rights and services. The GaaS framework must be built on a foundation of universal access.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Executive Commitment:** Chief Digital Officer (CDO) and leadership champion inclusion (not just efficiency/cost savings)
- **Legal Framework:** Enshrine right to access government services (digital or non-digital) in law
- **Adequate Funding:** Don't underfund inclusion (typically 5-10% of digital transformation budget)
- **Co-Design:** Design with excluded populations, not for them (see Playbook #3)
- **Measure & Report:** Track inclusion metrics, publish openly (transparency drives improvement)

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct digital divide assessment (survey, mapping, focus groups)
2. Establish Digital Inclusion Office (dedicated team, budget)
3. Audit all services for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
4. Launch digital literacy pilot (1-2 regions, 10,000 citizens)
5. Ensure multi-channel access (maintain phone and in-person for all major services)
6. Monitor and iterate (quarterly reviews, adjust strategy based on data)

**Remember:** Speed of digitalization must match pace of inclusion. Rushing ahead and leaving 20% behind is not success - it's failure. Build slowly, bring everyone along, and create a truly inclusive digital government.
