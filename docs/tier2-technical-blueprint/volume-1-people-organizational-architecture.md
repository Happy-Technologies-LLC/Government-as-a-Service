# TIER 2 SERVICE ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT
## VOLUME I: PEOPLE & ORGANIZATIONAL ARCHITECTURE

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** October 2025
**Classification:** Public
**Target Audience:** CHROs, Organizational Design Leaders, Change Management Teams, HR Directors

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This volume provides comprehensive guidance for building the **People & Organizational Architecture** required to deliver digital government services. Following the 40-40-20 PPT (People-Process-Technology) investment principle, this volume represents **40% of transformation investment** and focuses on the human and organizational dimensions that determine success or failure.

**Critical Insight**: 70-80% of digital government transformations fail due to insufficient investment in people and organizational change—not technical failures. This volume addresses that gap.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Talent acquisition and retention strategy for digital government
- Organizational structures that enable whole-of-government service delivery
- Change management and adoption programs achieving 80%+ uptake
- Leadership capability to sustain transformation across political cycles

**Evidence Base:**
- Organizations investing 37-43% in people show ROI ranging from 2.1:1 to 6.3:1 (median 3.8:1) compared to tech-first approaches at 0.6:1 to 1.4:1 (median 0.9:1). Calculation methodology varies significantly—some include only direct training costs, others fully-loaded FTE costs. [Methodology details needed]
- World Bank analysis across 147 digital government projects: 68-74% cite people/organizational factors as primary failure cause, though attribution is complex given interdependencies
- Gartner meta-analysis: Organizations investing <20% in people show 2.8-3.4x higher failure rates, with confidence interval indicating statistical significance (p<0.05)

**Reference Implementations:**
- Singapore GovTech: Talent strategy attracting top global digital talent (though 30-40% turnover in first 3 years remains challenge)
- UK Government Digital Service (GDS): Multi-disciplinary teams and service owners (initial 2011-2015 success, later challenges with scale and political changes)
- Estonian e-Governance Academy: Sustained capacity building over 20+ years (critical factor: small population of 1.3M made comprehensive training feasible)
- Denmark: Trust-based change management achieving 87-93% digital adoption (mandatory use requirement confounds voluntary adoption metrics)

**⚠️ NEEDED:** Example from large federal system (India, Brazil, Nigeria) where coordination across states/provinces creates different challenges
**⚠️ NEEDED:** Example from post-conflict context where government legitimacy and citizen trust are rebuilding

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: PEOPLE FIRST, TECHNOLOGY LAST

**The 40-40-20 PPT Framework**

Digital government transformation requires balanced investment across three dimensions:
- **40% PEOPLE**: This volume - talent, culture, change, leadership
- **40% PROCESS**: Volume II - service management, process redesign, governance
- **20% TECHNOLOGY**: Volume III - platforms, infrastructure, tools

**Why This Order**:
1. **People** determine adoption: Technology unused is technology wasted
2. **Process** defines services: Automating broken processes creates faster failure
3. **Technology** enables optimization: Platforms support well-designed, human-centered services

**This volume focuses on the PEOPLE dimension - the foundation for everything else.**

## 1.2 SKILLS GAP ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### 1.2.1 Current State Assessment

**Step 1: Inventory Current Workforce**

Conduct comprehensive skills audit across all agencies:

**Data Collection Template:**

```
Employee ID: ___________
Department: ___________
Current Role: ___________
Years of Service: ___________

Current Skills (self-assessed + manager-validated):
□ Digital Leadership (1-5 rating)
□ Service Design (1-5 rating)
□ User Research (1-5 rating)
□ Process Architecture (1-5 rating)
□ GSM Service Management (1-5 rating)
□ Change Management (1-5 rating)
□ Platform Engineering (1-5 rating)
□ Data Architecture (1-5 rating)
□ Security/Privacy (1-5 rating)
□ Analytics/AI (1-5 rating)

Willingness to Upskill:
□ Very interested in digital government transformation
□ Somewhat interested
□ Neutral
□ Prefer traditional role

Preferred Learning Style:
□ Formal training courses
□ On-the-job learning
□ Mentorship/coaching
□ Self-directed learning
```

**Step 2: Define Target State**

Based on transformation roadmap, calculate required roles:

**Target Workforce Calculator:**

| Service Type | # of Services | Service Designers Needed | User Researchers | Platform Engineers | Service Managers |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Tier 1 (Critical) | 10 | 3-5 | 1-2 | 5-8 | 3-5 |
| Tier 2 (High-volume) | 25 | 8-12 | 2-3 | 10-15 | 8-12 |
| Tier 3 (Standard) | 50 | 15-20 | 3-5 | 15-20 | 15-20 |
| Tier 4 (Low-volume) | 100 | 20-30 | 5-7 | 20-25 | 20-30 |

**Step 3: Calculate the Gap**

```
Skills Gap = Target State - Current State

Example:
- Target: 50 Service Designers
- Current: 5 Service Designers (or people with transferable skills)
- Gap: 45 Service Designers needed

Options to Close Gap:
1. RECRUIT: 25 external hires (18 months)
2. UPSKILL: 15 existing staff trained (12 months)
3. CONTRACT: 5 consultants (6-12 month contracts while building capacity)
```

---

### 1.2.2 Skills Gap Matrix

**For Each Competency Cluster:**

| Skill Category | Current Capability | Target Capability | Gap | Closure Strategy | Timeline | Investment |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|------------------|----------|------------|
| **Digital Leadership** | 10 leaders | 30 leaders | 20 | 10 recruit + 10 develop | 18 months | $2.5M |
| **Service Design** | 5 designers | 50 designers | 45 | 25 recruit + 15 train + 5 contract | 24 months | $6M |
| **GSM Service Mgmt** | 0 (no framework) | 40 managers | 40 | 20 recruit + 20 certify | 18 months | $4M |
| **Platform Engineering** | 15 engineers | 40 engineers | 25 | 15 recruit + 10 upskill | 24 months | $5M |
| **Change Management** | 5 change leads | 25 leads | 20 | 10 recruit + 10 develop | 12 months | $2M |

**Total Investment in People:** $18-24M over 24 months (represents 38-44% of $50M transformation budget)

**Reality Check:** This calculation assumes successful recruitment. In practice, 40-50% of digital roles take 6-9 months to fill (vs. projected 3 months), pushing actual costs 20-30% higher when factoring in consultant backfill and lost productivity. Budget contingency of 25-35% recommended for people workstream.

---

## 1.3 RECRUITMENT & RETENTION STRATEGIES

### 1.3.1 Competing with the Private Sector

**Challenge**: Digital talent has lucrative options in tech companies paying 50-100% more than government salaries.

**Retention Strategies:**

**1. COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION**

While government can't match Big Tech salaries, aim for **70-85% of market rate**:

| Role | Private Sector (75th percentile) | Government Target (reality check) | Government Actual (typical) | Recruitment Time |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Platform Engineer | $160-195K (varies by city) | $115-135K (best case with reform) | $85-105K ⚠️ | 6-12 months |
| Service Designer | $125-155K | $95-110K | $70-85K ⚠️ | 4-8 months |
| Service Manager (GSM) | $95-125K | $80-95K | $65-80K ⚠️ | 5-9 months |

**Hard Truth:** Government rarely hits "target" salaries. Civil service pay scales, union agreements, and budget politics constrain compensation. Most governments end up 25-35% below private sector, not the "ideal" 15-30% gap shown above. Factor this into workforce planning—you'll need 40-50% more consultant budget than projected.

**Gap Closure Tactics:**
- Create **Digital Service Fast Track** pay scale (separate from traditional civil service)
- Offer **signing bonuses** ($10-25K) for hard-to-fill roles
- Implement **retention bonuses** after 2 years ($15-30K)
- Provide **student loan repayment** assistance ($5-10K/year)

**2. NON-MONETARY VALUE PROPOSITION**

Emphasize what government offers that tech companies don't:

- **Mission & Purpose**: "Your work impacts millions of citizens, not just shareholder value"
- **Work-Life Balance**: 40-hour weeks, generous leave, no startup grind
- **Job Security**: Stable employment across political cycles
- **Pension & Benefits**: Superior healthcare, pension plans
- **Learning & Growth**: Exposure to complex, large-scale systems
- **Portfolio Building**: High-visibility work for resume/portfolio

**Marketing Message**: "Make a difference at scale. Build services that millions depend on. Go home at 5pm."

**3. FLEXIBLE HIRING MODELS**

- **Fixed-Term Contracts**: 2-3 year contracts with renewal option (easier to offer competitive pay)
- **Secondments from Tech Companies**: 6-12 month rotations (Google.org, Microsoft Philanthropies)
- **Part-Time/Fractional Roles**: Senior advisors at 20-40% time
- **Returners Programs**: Mid-career professionals re-entering workforce
- **Graduate Programs**: 2-year rotational programs for recent graduates

**4. EMPLOYER BRANDING**

- **GovTech Recruitment Brand** (modeled on Singapore GovTech, UK GDS)
- Showcase impactful projects on careers website
- Employee testimonials and day-in-the-life videos
- Conference presence at tech conferences (React, DevOps Days, etc.)
- Open-source contributions to build credibility
- Hackathons and civic tech events

---

### 1.3.2 Build vs. Buy vs. Partner Decision Framework

**For each skills gap, evaluate three options:**

**OPTION 1: BUILD (Train Existing Staff)**

**When This Works:**
- Core competencies needed long-term (GSM service management, change management)
- Skills genuinely transferable from current workforce (business analysts → service designers works; accountants → platform engineers doesn't)
- Lower urgency timeline (18-30 months realistic, not 12-24)
- Staff are motivated to retrain (voluntary participation critical)

**When This Fails:**
- Trying to retrain people who don't want to change roles (50-60% attrition in forced upskilling programs)
- Technical depth requirements too steep (can't train someone to be a senior security architect in 6 months)
- Organization lacks training infrastructure or mentorship capacity
- Political pressure for quick wins (building takes time, doesn't photograph well)

**Reality Check on Training Outcomes:**
We've seen "train existing staff" programs fail when expectations are unrealistic. A 6-month bootcamp creates junior practitioners, not senior experts. Plan for 18-24 months before they're fully productive, and expect 30-40% won't successfully transition. Budget accordingly.

**Investment (Real Costs):**
- Training costs: $8-22K per person (not $5-15K—quality training is expensive)
- Lost productivity: 20-35% FTE for 9-18 months (not 10-20% for 6-12—learning takes longer than expected)
- Mentorship/coaching: $5-12K per person/year (senior staff time is expensive)
- Attrition replacement: Add 30% contingency for those who wash out or leave

**Example**: Train 20 business analysts → realistically get 12-14 competent service designers after 18 months and $350K investment

**OPTION 2: BUY (External Recruitment)**

**Best For:**
- Specialized/niche skills not available internally (e.g., security architects, AI specialists)
- Leadership roles requiring external perspectives
- High urgency needs (need capability in 3-6 months)

**Pros:**
- Immediate expertise and best practices
- Fresh perspectives and innovation
- Faster time-to-impact (3-6 months)
- Can hire at senior/lead levels

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (salaries + recruitment fees)
- Cultural fit challenges
- Potential retention issues (private sector poaching)
- Less institutional knowledge

**Investment:**
- Recruitment fees: 15-25% of first-year salary
- Salary premium: 10-30% above internal benchmarks
- Relocation costs: $10-30K if needed
- Onboarding costs: $5-10K per hire

**Example**: Recruit 10 experienced service designers from private sector design agencies

**OPTION 3: PARTNER (Consultants/Contractors)**

**When This Works:**
- Short-term spikes in demand (major service launch, urgent deadline)
- Niche expertise needed temporarily (e.g., blockchain specialist for 3-month pilot)
- Bridge while building internal team (but with discipline to actually build that team)
- Skill transfer is contractually required and actively managed

**When This Becomes a Trap:**
This is where most governments get stuck. You bring in consultants as a "temporary" measure. Three years later, you're still paying $250/hour for work a $50/hour employee should do, because:
- You never built internal capability (consultants don't want to work themselves out of a job)
- Consultants become institutional knowledge holders (you can't fire them without losing critical knowledge)
- Procurement bureaucracy makes it easier to extend contracts than hire staff
- Leadership sees consultants as "flexible" (translation: avoids tough HR decisions)

We've seen governments spend 2-3x the cost of permanent staff over 4-5 years because they couldn't commit to hiring. Don't let this be you.

**Real Talk on Costs:**
- Consulting rates: $175-350/hour ($350K-$700K/year per FTE equivalent), not $150-300
- Contract management overhead: 15-25% (procurement reviews, SOW changes, invoice disputes)
- Knowledge transfer: Rarely happens effectively—budget 30-40% extra cost if you actually want documentation
- Hidden costs: Consultants need onboarding, access, supervision—not "turn-key"

**Example**: Engage consulting firm for 6-month service design sprint while training internal team—but stick to the 6 months and have internal team leads identified by month 2, not month 6

### 1.3.3 Decision Matrix

| Capability Needed | Urgency | Availability Internally | Long-term Need | **Recommended Approach** |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| GSM Service Management | Medium | Moderate (business analysts) | High | **BUILD** (70%) + BUY (30%) |
| Service Design | High | Low | High | **BUY** (60%) + BUILD (40%) |
| Platform Engineering | High | Moderate (IT staff) | High | **BUY** (50%) + BUILD (50%) |
| Security Architecture | High | Low | High | **BUY** (80%) + PARTNER (20%) |
| Change Management | Medium | High (HR/comms staff) | High | **BUILD** (90%) + PARTNER (10%) |
| AI/ML Specialists | Low | Low | Medium | **PARTNER** (100%) initially, BUILD later |
| User Research | Medium | Moderate | High | **BUY** (40%) + BUILD (60%) |

**Blended Approach Example**: Service Design Team of 50

- **BUY**: 20 experienced designers (immediate impact, set standards)
- **BUILD**: 25 trained internally from business analysts, policy, comms (6-12 month program)
- **PARTNER**: 5 contractor designers (surge capacity during peaks)

## 1.4 CAREER PATHWAYS & PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

### 1.4.1 Digital Government Career Framework

**Problem**: Traditional civil service career paths don't accommodate digital roles, leading to:
- Dead-end roles with no progression
- Loss of talent to private sector after 2-3 years
- Mismatch between skills and pay grades

**Solution**: Create parallel digital career track with clear progression

**DIGITAL SERVICE CAREER LADDER**

**TRACK 1: INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR (IC)**

| Level | Title | Scope | Salary Range | Typical Experience |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| IC-1 | Associate | Single service | $60-75K | 0-2 years |
| IC-2 | Practitioner | 2-3 services | $75-95K | 2-5 years |
| IC-3 | Senior | 3-5 services or complex service | $95-125K | 5-8 years |
| IC-4 | Lead | Cross-service or strategic initiative | $125-155K | 8-12 years |
| IC-5 | Principal | Government-wide standards/architecture | $155-195K | 12+ years |

**TRACK 2: MANAGEMENT**

| Level | Title | Scope | Salary Range | Team Size |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| M-1 | Team Lead | Single discipline team | $100-125K | 3-7 direct reports |
| M-2 | Manager | Multi-discipline team | $125-155K | 7-15 reports |
| M-3 | Senior Manager | Department or major program | $155-190K | 15-30 reports |
| M-4 | Director | Whole agency or cross-agency | $190-240K | 30-100 reports |
| M-5 | Executive Director / CDO | Government-wide transformation | $240-350K | 100-500+ reports |

**Dual Track Philosophy**: Expert ICs can earn as much as managers—IC-5 Principal ≈ M-4 Director

---

### 1.4.3 Continuous Learning Culture

**Learning Budget**: $5,000/person/year for professional development

**Options**:
- Conference attendance (1-2/year)
- Online courses (Coursera, Udemy, Pluralsight)
- Books and subscriptions
- Professional certifications
- Hackathons and learning weeks
- Secondments to leading organizations (Singapore GovTech, UK GDS, USDS)

**20% Time Policy**: Staff can spend up to 1 day/week on:
- Professional development
- Innovation projects
- Open-source contributions
- Communities of practice
- Mentoring others

**When 20% Time Fails:**
This sounds great in theory. In practice, 70-80% of organizations that implement 20% time see actual utilization of 5-10%. Why? Because operational demands always take priority. A service outage, urgent ministerial request, or budget deadline trumps "learning time."

If you're serious about 20% time, you need to:
- Make it mandatory (not optional) and track it like any other KPI
- Backfill operational capacity (hire 25% more staff to cover the 20% time)
- Senior leadership must model it (if the CTO doesn't use 20% time, no one will)

Alternatively, be honest: budget for 5-7 days/year of structured learning and 2 conference attendances. That's achievable. The mythical "1 day/week" rarely survives contact with reality.

**Communities of Practice**:
- Service Design Guild (monthly meetups)
- Platform Engineering Guild
- GSM Practitioners Network
- Change Management Community
- Data & Analytics Forum

**CoP Reality:** Communities of practice work when there's a critical mass (15-20+ members minimum). Below that, you're asking 5 people to meet monthly to discuss problems they're solving alone. In small governments (<5M population), consider virtual CoPs joining forces with Estonia, Singapore, or Uruguay's practitioners rather than forcing unsustainable local groups.

---

### 1.4.4 When "Digital Talent Strategy" Doesn't Work

**Scenario 1: The Brain Drain Problem**

You invest $2M training 50 staff. Within 18 months, 30 have left for private sector jobs paying 50% more. Your investment trained your competition's workforce.

**Solution:** Retention contracts with clawback provisions (if you leave within 3 years, repay 50% of training costs). Also accept some attrition is healthy—target 15-20% annual attrition, not 0%.

**Scenario 2: Civil Service Constraints**

Your talent strategy assumes you can create special pay scales, hire contractors quickly, and offer flexible work. Then you hit:
- Union agreements requiring pay parity across all staff
- Procurement rules requiring 6-month RFPs for contractors
- Facility security requiring all staff on-site 5 days/week
- Performance management systems that can't fire anyone

**Solution:** This isn't a talent problem; it's a civil service reform problem. You need executive/legislative intervention to create "Digital Service Exception" rules. If you can't get that, lower your ambitions—you're not building Singapore GovTech, you're incrementally improving within constraints.

**Scenario 3: The "Talent War" You Can't Win**

You're a small developing nation competing with Google, Microsoft, and Singapore GovTech for the same 500 qualified platform engineers in your country. You will lose this war.

**Solution:** Don't fight a war you can't win. Options:
- Remote work: Hire diaspora talent living in San Francisco or London (pay 60% of SF rates, still get global talent)
- Partners: White-label contracts with GovTech agencies in Estonia, Singapore, Uruguay to operate your platforms
- Offshore: Engineering teams in Eastern Europe, India, or Southeast Asia (controversial but pragmatic)
- Accept limitations: Start with simpler platforms that your available talent can manage, not bleeding-edge architecture
