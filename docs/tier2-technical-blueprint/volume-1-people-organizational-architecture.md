# TIER 2 SERVICE ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT
## VOLUME I: PEOPLE & ORGANIZATIONAL ARCHITECTURE

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** October 2025
**Classification:** Public
**Target Audience:** CHROs, Organizational Design Leaders, Change Management Teams, HR Directors

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This volume provides comprehensive guidance for building the **People & Organizational Architecture** required to deliver digital government services. Following the 40-40-20 PPT (People-Process-Technology) investment principle, this volume represents **40% of transformation investment** and focuses on the human and organizational dimensions that determine success or failure.

**Critical Insight**: 70-80% of digital government transformations fail due to insufficient investment in people and organizational change—not technical failures. This volume addresses that gap.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Talent acquisition and retention strategy for digital government
- Organizational structures that enable whole-of-government service delivery
- Change management and adoption programs achieving 80%+ uptake
- Leadership capability to sustain transformation across political cycles

**Evidence Base:**
- Organizations investing 40% in people achieve **85% higher ROI** (4.2:1 vs. 0.8:1)
- World Bank analysis: 70% of failures due to people/process neglect
- Gartner: <20% investment in people = 3x higher failure rates

**Reference Implementations:**
- Singapore GovTech: Talent strategy attracting top global digital talent
- UK Government Digital Service (GDS): Multi-disciplinary teams and service owners
- Estonian e-Governance Academy: Sustained capacity building model
- Denmark: Trust-based change management achieving 90%+ digital adoption

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: PEOPLE FIRST, TECHNOLOGY LAST

**The 40-40-20 PPT Framework**

Digital government transformation requires balanced investment across three dimensions:
- **40% PEOPLE**: This volume - talent, culture, change, leadership
- **40% PROCESS**: Volume II - service management, process redesign, governance
- **20% TECHNOLOGY**: Volume III - platforms, infrastructure, tools

**Why This Order**:
1. **People** determine adoption: Technology unused is technology wasted
2. **Process** defines services: Automating broken processes creates faster failure
3. **Technology** enables optimization: Platforms support well-designed, human-centered services

**This volume focuses on the PEOPLE dimension - the foundation for everything else.**

## 1.2 SKILLS GAP ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### 1.2.1 Current State Assessment

**Step 1: Inventory Current Workforce**

Conduct comprehensive skills audit across all agencies:

**Data Collection Template:**

```
Employee ID: ___________
Department: ___________
Current Role: ___________
Years of Service: ___________

Current Skills (self-assessed + manager-validated):
□ Digital Leadership (1-5 rating)
□ Service Design (1-5 rating)
□ User Research (1-5 rating)
□ Process Architecture (1-5 rating)
□ GSM Service Management (1-5 rating)
□ Change Management (1-5 rating)
□ Platform Engineering (1-5 rating)
□ Data Architecture (1-5 rating)
□ Security/Privacy (1-5 rating)
□ Analytics/AI (1-5 rating)

Willingness to Upskill:
□ Very interested in digital government transformation
□ Somewhat interested
□ Neutral
□ Prefer traditional role

Preferred Learning Style:
□ Formal training courses
□ On-the-job learning
□ Mentorship/coaching
□ Self-directed learning
```

**Step 2: Define Target State**

Based on transformation roadmap, calculate required roles:

**Target Workforce Calculator:**

| Service Type | # of Services | Service Designers Needed | User Researchers | Platform Engineers | Service Managers |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Tier 1 (Critical) | 10 | 3-5 | 1-2 | 5-8 | 3-5 |
| Tier 2 (High-volume) | 25 | 8-12 | 2-3 | 10-15 | 8-12 |
| Tier 3 (Standard) | 50 | 15-20 | 3-5 | 15-20 | 15-20 |
| Tier 4 (Low-volume) | 100 | 20-30 | 5-7 | 20-25 | 20-30 |

**Step 3: Calculate the Gap**

```
Skills Gap = Target State - Current State

Example:
- Target: 50 Service Designers
- Current: 5 Service Designers (or people with transferable skills)
- Gap: 45 Service Designers needed

Options to Close Gap:
1. RECRUIT: 25 external hires (18 months)
2. UPSKILL: 15 existing staff trained (12 months)
3. CONTRACT: 5 consultants (6-12 month contracts while building capacity)
```

---

### 1.2.2 Skills Gap Matrix

**For Each Competency Cluster:**

| Skill Category | Current Capability | Target Capability | Gap | Closure Strategy | Timeline | Investment |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|------------------|----------|------------|
| **Digital Leadership** | 10 leaders | 30 leaders | 20 | 10 recruit + 10 develop | 18 months | $2.5M |
| **Service Design** | 5 designers | 50 designers | 45 | 25 recruit + 15 train + 5 contract | 24 months | $6M |
| **GSM Service Mgmt** | 0 (no framework) | 40 managers | 40 | 20 recruit + 20 certify | 18 months | $4M |
| **Platform Engineering** | 15 engineers | 40 engineers | 25 | 15 recruit + 10 upskill | 24 months | $5M |
| **Change Management** | 5 change leads | 25 leads | 20 | 10 recruit + 10 develop | 12 months | $2M |

**Total Investment in People:** ~$20M over 24 months (40% of $50M transformation budget)

---

## 1.3 RECRUITMENT & RETENTION STRATEGIES

### 1.3.1 Competing with the Private Sector

**Challenge**: Digital talent has lucrative options in tech companies paying 50-100% more than government salaries.

**Retention Strategies:**

**1. COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION**

While government can't match Big Tech salaries, aim for **70-85% of market rate**:

| Role | Private Sector | Government Target | Government Actual (typical) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Platform Engineer | $180K | $125-145K | $85-105K ⚠️ |
| Service Designer | $140K | $100-115K | $70-85K ⚠️ |
| Service Manager (GSM) | $110K | $85-100K | $65-80K ⚠️ |

**Gap Closure Tactics:**
- Create **Digital Service Fast Track** pay scale (separate from traditional civil service)
- Offer **signing bonuses** ($10-25K) for hard-to-fill roles
- Implement **retention bonuses** after 2 years ($15-30K)
- Provide **student loan repayment** assistance ($5-10K/year)

**2. NON-MONETARY VALUE PROPOSITION**

Emphasize what government offers that tech companies don't:

- **Mission & Purpose**: "Your work impacts millions of citizens, not just shareholder value"
- **Work-Life Balance**: 40-hour weeks, generous leave, no startup grind
- **Job Security**: Stable employment across political cycles
- **Pension & Benefits**: Superior healthcare, pension plans
- **Learning & Growth**: Exposure to complex, large-scale systems
- **Portfolio Building**: High-visibility work for resume/portfolio

**Marketing Message**: "Make a difference at scale. Build services that millions depend on. Go home at 5pm."

**3. FLEXIBLE HIRING MODELS**

- **Fixed-Term Contracts**: 2-3 year contracts with renewal option (easier to offer competitive pay)
- **Secondments from Tech Companies**: 6-12 month rotations (Google.org, Microsoft Philanthropies)
- **Part-Time/Fractional Roles**: Senior advisors at 20-40% time
- **Returners Programs**: Mid-career professionals re-entering workforce
- **Graduate Programs**: 2-year rotational programs for recent graduates

**4. EMPLOYER BRANDING**

- **GovTech Recruitment Brand** (modeled on Singapore GovTech, UK GDS)
- Showcase impactful projects on careers website
- Employee testimonials and day-in-the-life videos
- Conference presence at tech conferences (React, DevOps Days, etc.)
- Open-source contributions to build credibility
- Hackathons and civic tech events

---

### 1.3.2 Build vs. Buy vs. Partner Decision Framework

**For each skills gap, evaluate three options:**

**OPTION 1: BUILD (Train Existing Staff)**

**Best For:**
- Core competencies needed long-term (e.g., GSM service management)
- Skills transferable from current workforce (e.g., business analysts → service designers)
- Lower urgency timeline (12-24 months acceptable)

**Pros:**
- Retains institutional knowledge
- Builds long-term organizational capability
- More cost-effective over 3+ years
- Higher retention (staff already committed to public service)

**Cons:**
- Slower time-to-capability (12-24 months)
- May not achieve world-class expertise
- Requires significant training investment upfront
- Opportunity cost while staff are learning

**Investment:**
- Training costs: $5-15K per person
- Lost productivity during training: 10-20% FTE for 6-12 months
- Ongoing mentorship/coaching: $2-5K per person/year

**Example**: Train 20 existing business analysts to become service designers via 6-month intensive program

**OPTION 2: BUY (External Recruitment)**

**Best For:**
- Specialized/niche skills not available internally (e.g., security architects, AI specialists)
- Leadership roles requiring external perspectives
- High urgency needs (need capability in 3-6 months)

**Pros:**
- Immediate expertise and best practices
- Fresh perspectives and innovation
- Faster time-to-impact (3-6 months)
- Can hire at senior/lead levels

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (salaries + recruitment fees)
- Cultural fit challenges
- Potential retention issues (private sector poaching)
- Less institutional knowledge

**Investment:**
- Recruitment fees: 15-25% of first-year salary
- Salary premium: 10-30% above internal benchmarks
- Relocation costs: $10-30K if needed
- Onboarding costs: $5-10K per hire

**Example**: Recruit 10 experienced service designers from private sector design agencies

**OPTION 3: PARTNER (Consultants/Contractors)**

**Best For:**
- Short-term spikes in demand (e.g., major service launch)
- Highly specialized expertise needed temporarily (e.g., blockchain expert for identity pilot)
- While building internal capability (bridge to permanent team)

**Pros:**
- Flexible/scalable (can ramp up/down quickly)
- Access to cutting-edge expertise
- Lower long-term commitment
- Can serve as "try before you buy" for permanent hires

**Cons:**
- Most expensive option long-term ($150-300/hour vs. $50-75/hour FTE equivalent)
- Knowledge walks out the door when contract ends
- May not build organizational capability
- Potential conflicts of interest with vendors

**Investment:**
- Consulting rates: $150-300/hour ($300-600K/year per FTE equivalent)
- Contract management overhead: 10-15% of contract value
- Knowledge transfer time: Additional 10-20% cost

**Example**: Engage consulting firm for 6-month service design sprint while training internal team

### 1.3.3 Decision Matrix

| Capability Needed | Urgency | Availability Internally | Long-term Need | **Recommended Approach** |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| GSM Service Management | Medium | Moderate (business analysts) | High | **BUILD** (70%) + BUY (30%) |
| Service Design | High | Low | High | **BUY** (60%) + BUILD (40%) |
| Platform Engineering | High | Moderate (IT staff) | High | **BUY** (50%) + BUILD (50%) |
| Security Architecture | High | Low | High | **BUY** (80%) + PARTNER (20%) |
| Change Management | Medium | High (HR/comms staff) | High | **BUILD** (90%) + PARTNER (10%) |
| AI/ML Specialists | Low | Low | Medium | **PARTNER** (100%) initially, BUILD later |
| User Research | Medium | Moderate | High | **BUY** (40%) + BUILD (60%) |

**Blended Approach Example**: Service Design Team of 50

- **BUY**: 20 experienced designers (immediate impact, set standards)
- **BUILD**: 25 trained internally from business analysts, policy, comms (6-12 month program)
- **PARTNER**: 5 contractor designers (surge capacity during peaks)

| IC-3 | Senior | 3-5 services or complex service | $95-125K | 5-8 years |
| IC-4 | Lead | Cross-service or strategic initiative | $125-155K | 8-12 years |
| IC-5 | Principal | Government-wide standards/architecture | $155-195K | 12+ years |

**TRACK 2: MANAGEMENT**

| Level | Title | Scope | Salary Range | Team Size |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| M-1 | Team Lead | Single discipline team | $100-125K | 3-7 direct reports |
| M-2 | Manager | Multi-discipline team | $125-155K | 7-15 reports |
| M-3 | Senior Manager | Department or major program | $155-190K | 15-30 reports |
| M-4 | Director | Whole agency or cross-agency | $190-240K | 30-100 reports |
| M-5 | Executive Director / CDO | Government-wide transformation | $240-350K | 100-500+ reports |
