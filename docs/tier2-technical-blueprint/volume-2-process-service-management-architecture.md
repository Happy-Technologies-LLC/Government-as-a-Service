## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This volume provides comprehensive guidance for designing and operating **Process & Service Management Architecture** for digital government. Following the 40-40-20 PPT investment principle, this volume represents **40% of transformation investment** and focuses on service delivery processes and operational excellence.

**Critical Insight**: Technology platforms are only as good as the processes they enable and the services they deliver. This volume ensures governments design citizen-centric services with robust operational management using the **GSM (Government Service Management) framework**.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Citizen-centric service catalog with clear service levels (SLAs)
- GSM framework implementation for operational excellence
- Incident, problem, and change management achieving 99.9%+ availability
- Business process reengineering delivering 40-60% efficiency gains
- Continual service improvement culture driving ongoing innovation

**Evidence Base:**
- Organizations with mature service management (GSM Level 3-4) show 52-68% fewer service disruptions compared to ad-hoc approaches (baseline: 8-12 P1 incidents/year → 2-4/year). However, reaching Level 3 typically requires 24-36 months of sustained investment.
- Governments implementing GSM-aligned practices report satisfaction scores ranging from 7.2-8.4/10 (vs. 5.8-6.9/10 for traditional approaches). Attribution is challenging—satisfaction correlates with service quality, not just management frameworks.
- Process redesign before technology deployment shows 54-73% lower failure rates in post-implementation reviews. The causation debate continues: is it the redesign itself, or that organizations mature enough to redesign first are simply better governed?
- Continual improvement programs show annual efficiency gains of 3-12% in first 3 years, then diminishing returns (1-3% in years 4-6). The "5-15% forever" claim doesn't account for maturity curves.

**Reference Implementations:**
- Singapore: GSM-style service management with 97% Singpass adoption (though mandatory for most services makes "adoption" somewhat compulsory). The $385M value figure is contested—does it include opportunity cost of alternatives?
- Estonia: Once-only principle claimed to save 834 hours/year per citizen. Methodology: assumes every data reuse saves 15 minutes of form-filling. Critics note small population (1.3M) makes comprehensive integration feasible; less clear how this scales to 100M+ populations.
- Denmark: Co-designed services achieving 87-92% digital adoption. The "90% despite mandatory use" framing is interesting—mandatory use partially drives adoption, so unclear how much co-design contributed vs. regulatory requirement.
- UK GDS: Service standard defining excellence (2013-2016 era). Later challenges: maintaining standards across 500+ services proved difficult; some ministries resisted central mandates. Initial success was clearer than sustained implementation.

**⚠️ NEEDED:** Example from federal system (Brazil, India) where state/provincial autonomy complicates whole-of-government service standards
**⚠️ NEEDED:** Example from lower-capacity context showing what's achievable with <100 digital staff

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: PROCESS BEFORE TECHNOLOGY

**The 40-40-20 PPT Framework**

- **40% PEOPLE**: Volume I - talent, culture, change, leadership
- **40% PROCESS**: **This volume** - service management, process design, governance
- **20% TECHNOLOGY**: Volume III - platforms, infrastructure, tools

**Why Process Comes Second**:
1. **People define what's needed**: Services must meet citizen needs, not technology capabilities
2. **Process defines how it works**: Well-designed processes ensure services are reliable, efficient, equitable
3. **Technology enables at scale**: Platforms automate optimized processes, not broken ones

**Cardinal Rule**: Never automate a broken process. Redesign first, then digitize.

# CHAPTER 5: GSM SERVICE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

## 5.1 INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNMENT SERVICE MANAGEMENT (GSM)

### 5.1.1 The Problem: Government Services Are Unreliable and Frustrating

**The Firefighting Trap**

Most governments operate in perpetual firefighting mode. A service goes down at 3pm on Friday. The team scrambles, working through the weekend. By Monday, the service is back up. Everyone celebrates. The same service goes down again two weeks later. Nobody remembers why—no postmortem was done. This cycle repeats monthly.

Meanwhile, citizens experience:
- "The portal is down again" (99.2-99.5% uptime = 3.6-7 hours downtime per month, often during peak usage)
- "I submitted my application but got no confirmation" (no transaction tracking)
- "The requirements changed while I was filling the form" (uncontrolled changes)
- "I can never reach anyone who can help" (no service desk)

**The Cost of No Process**

A mid-sized government (10M population) with 100 digital services experiences:
- 120-180 service disruptions per year (major incidents requiring manual intervention)
- 15,000-25,000 support tickets manually triaged (no categorization, no knowledge base)
- 2,000-3,500 changes deployed with no risk assessment or rollback plan
- $8-15M annual cost in firefighting, redundant fixes, and citizen frustration

**GSM as a Solution (Not a Panacea)**

Government Service Management (GSM) provides structured processes to move from reactive firefighting to proactive management. It's inspired by corporate IT Service Management (ITSM/ITIL) but adapted for government context: citizen-centric, transparent, accountable, equitable.

![Why GSM is Different: Government Service Management vs. Corporate ITSM](/images/infographics/infographic-7-gsm-vs-itsm.png)

**What GSM Does Well:**
- Defines clear service levels (SLAs) so citizens know what to expect
- Incident management processes that restore service quickly (MTTR <1 hour for critical services)
- Change management that balances innovation with stability
- Problem management that fixes root causes, not just symptoms
- Continual improvement culture

**What GSM Doesn't Solve:**
- Bad technology choices (GSM can't fix a fundamentally broken architecture)
- Organizational silos (you need governance reform, not just process)
- Lack of funding (GSM requires 5-10% of IT budget for ITSM tooling and staff)
- Political interference (e.g., minister demanding deploy "today" without testing)

**Realistic GSM Outcomes:**

After 24 months of disciplined GSM implementation:
- Uptime improves from 99.2-99.5% to 99.7-99.9% (still not perfect—that's 99.99%)
- Major incidents drop from 120-180/year to 30-50/year (not to zero—incidents happen)
- MTTR drops from 4-8 hours to 1-2 hours for P1 incidents
- Citizen satisfaction improves from 6.2-6.8/10 to 7.5-8.2/10
- Support ticket volume remains similar but resolution time drops 40-60%

This is good progress, not miracles. Anyone promising "zero incidents" or "100% automation" is selling, not practicing.

## 5.2 SERVICE STRATEGY: DEFINING THE CITIZEN-CENTRIC SERVICE PORTFOLIO

### 5.2.1 Service Catalog Design

**What is a Service Catalog?**

A service catalog is the authoritative source listing all services government provides to citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. It answers: "What services does government offer?" and "How do I access them?"

**Two-Layer Catalog Model:**

**Layer 1: SERVICE CATALOG (Citizen-Facing)**
- Lists services in plain language citizens understand
- Organizes by life events, not government departments
- Shows eligibility, channels, costs, service levels

**Layer 2: TECHNICAL CATALOG (Internal)**
- Shows underlying components and dependencies
- Lists APIs, databases, integrations required
- Tracks service owners and support teams

**Service Catalog Template:**

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Service Name** | "Register a Birth" | Plain language, citizen-understood |
| **Service ID** | SVC-001 | Unique identifier for tracking |
| **Service Description** | "Register the birth of your child to obtain a birth certificate. Required for passport, school enrollment, and benefits." | Clear purpose and outcomes |
| **Life Event** | Birth & Family | Groups related services |
| **Eligibility** | "Parents of child born in [Country]" | Who can use this |
| **Channels** | Online (24/7), Mobile App, In-Person (8am-5pm Mon-Fri) | How to access |
| **Service Level** | Tier 1 (Critical) - 99.9% uptime, 24-hour processing | Commitments |
| **Cost** | Free | Price transparency |
| **Service Owner** | Ministry of Health - John Smith | Accountability |
| **Dependencies** | Population Registry (SVC-020), Digital Identity (SVC-002) | Technical linkages |
| **Related Services** | Apply for Passport (SVC-015), Enroll in Healthcare (SVC-030) | Journey connections |

---

### 5.2.2 Service Portfolio Hierarchy & Cost Visibility

**Beyond the Basic Catalog: Hierarchical Service Portfolios**

![Hierarchical Service Portfolio & Cost Decomposition](/images/infographics/infographic-9-hierarchical-portfolio.png)

While the two-layer catalog above provides citizen-facing and technical views, **service portfolio management** adds a critical financial and governance dimension based on ITIL Service Portfolio Management, industry-standard Common Services Data Model (CSDM) patterns, and Technology Business Management (TBM) frameworks.

**The 5-Level Service Hierarchy:**

Modern service portfolio management decomposes services from the business level down to infrastructure, enabling complete cost transparency and impact analysis:

**Level 1: Business Services** (Citizen-Facing)
- Example: "Healthcare Insurance Service"
- What citizens see and use
- Organized by service domains (Healthcare, Education, Justice, etc.)

**Level 2: Technical Services** (Supporting Backend)
- Example: "Eligibility Verification Service," "Claims Processing Service"
- Backend services that support business services
- Often consumed by multiple business services

**Level 3: Applications**
- Example: "Healthcare Portal (React)," "Claims API (Java)," "Provider Directory (PostgreSQL)"
- Software systems delivering technical services
- Tracked in CMDB with version control

**Level 4: Infrastructure**
- Example: "50 EC2 instances," "2TB RDS storage," "CloudFront CDN"
- Compute, storage, network resources supporting applications
- Mapped to cost allocation

**Level 5: Cost Allocation** (PPT Breakdown)
- People: FTE costs allocated to service (e.g., 100 FTE @ $200K fully-loaded = $20M)
- Process: Service management operations, compliance, QA (e.g., $15M)
- Technology: Infrastructure + software + cloud costs (e.g., $10M)

**Why This Matters: The "Healthcare IT" Question**

Without hierarchical service portfolios, executives cannot answer: "How much does Healthcare IT cost us?" or "What happens to infrastructure if we expand healthcare insurance services?"

With service portfolio management:
- **Cost Visibility**: "Healthcare domain IT costs $120M/year, Education $80M/year"
- **Impact Analysis**: "Expanding healthcare insurance by 100K users requires 15 additional servers, $2.5M infrastructure"
- **Isolated Governance**: Healthcare CIO owns healthcare services, budgets, and infrastructure
- **PPT Balance Tracking**: Monitor 40-40-20 investment by service domain

**Service Domain Governance Model:**

| Domain | Annual IT Budget | Services | Dedicated FTE | Infrastructure |
|--------|-----------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Healthcare | $120M | Insurance, Research, Public Health | 50 FTE | Healthcare-specific servers |
| Education | $80M | K-12, Higher Ed, Scholarships | 30 FTE | Education portals, LMS |
| Justice | $60M | Courts, Prisons, Legal Aid | 25 FTE | Case management systems |
| Shared Services | $50M | Digital Identity, Payments | 40 FTE | Cross-domain platforms |

**Implementation Note:** See **Tier 3 Playbook #10: Service Portfolio & Cost Management** for complete implementation guidance including TBM cost allocation methodology, service hierarchy templates, and 18-month roadmap.

**Integration with CMDB (Configuration Management Database):**
- Configuration Items (CIs) mapped to applications and infrastructure
- Service relationships tracked (Business Service → Technical Service → Application → CI)
- Cost allocation automated through CMDB attributes
- Impact analysis powered by service dependency mapping
- **Recommended Open Source CMDBs:** GaaS Platform, iTop, GLPI, Ralph

---

### 5.2.3 Service Classification Framework

**Not all services are equal—classify by criticality and volume to allocate resources appropriately:**

**TIER 1: CRITICAL SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: Essential for daily life, high citizen dependency, safety/security impact
- **Examples**: Digital Identity, Emergency Services, Healthcare Access, Social Benefits
- **Service Level**: 99.99% uptime (52 min/year downtime), 24/7 support, <1 hour P1 incident response
- **Investment**: Premium infrastructure, 24/7 operations, redundancy, monitoring
- **Volume**: Typically 5-10 services

**TIER 2: HIGH-VOLUME SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: High transaction volume, significant citizen touchpoints, economic impact
- **Examples**: Tax Filing, Business Registration, Vehicle Registration, Visa Applications
- **Service Level**: 99.9% uptime (8 hours/year downtime), business hours support, <4 hour P1 response
- **Investment**: Robust infrastructure, dedicated support team, scaling capability
- **Volume**: Typically 15-30 services

**TIER 3: STANDARD SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: Regular use, moderate volume, standard importance
- **Examples**: License Renewals, Permit Applications, Information Requests
- **Service Level**: 99.5% uptime (1.8 days/year), business hours support, <8 hour P1 response
- **Investment**: Shared infrastructure, standard operations, basic monitoring
- **Volume**: Typically 50-100 services

**TIER 4: LOW-VOLUME SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: Infrequent use, niche audiences, low criticality
- **Examples**: Special Permits, Archive Requests, Historical Records
- **Service Level**: 99% uptime (3.6 days/year), email support, <24 hour P1 response
- **Investment**: Minimal infrastructure, self-service emphasis, basic support
- **Volume**: Typically 100-500 services

**Resource Allocation Rule**: Tier 1 services receive 40% of operational budget despite being only 1-2% of service count

---

## 5.3 SERVICE DESIGN & CO-CREATION

### 5.3.1 Citizen-Centric Service Design Methodology

**Traditional Government Approach** (Department-Centric):
- Organized by ministry/agency structure
- Citizens navigate complex org charts
- Multiple touchpoints for single life event
- Redundant data collection across agencies
- One-size-fits-all processes

**GSM Approach** (Citizen-Centric):
- Organized by life events and citizen journeys
- Single service for complex life events
- Once-only data principle (tell us once)
- Personalized based on eligibility and needs
- Co-designed with actual citizens

---

### 5.3.2 Service Blueprinting: Where Services Actually Break

**The Problem with Service Blueprints**

We've all seen the beautiful service blueprint diagrams with clean boxes and arrows showing "citizen journey" → "frontstage" → "backstage" → "systems." They look great in PowerPoint. Then you deploy the service and discover:

- The "automated identity verification" fails for 15% of users (old addresses, name changes, database sync lag)
- The "eligibility rules engine" was coded by someone who misunderstood the policy
- The "inter-agency data exchange API" times out 20% of the time during peak hours
- The "AI document validation" confidently rejects 8% of valid documents

**Service blueprinting is valuable, but only if you blueprint the failure modes, not just the happy path.**

**Service Blueprint Breakdown Points:**

1. **CITIZEN ACTIONS** (What citizen does)
   - Research eligibility → **Problem:** Eligibility rules are ambiguous, 30% of citizens self-assess incorrectly
   - Create account / authenticate → **Problem:** 10-15% can't complete MFA (elderly, rural users with poor SMS reception)
   - Fill application form → **Problem:** Average 28% form abandonment due to complexity or unclear questions
   - Upload documents → **Problem:** 12% of uploads fail (file size, format issues, mobile photo quality)
   - Submit and pay → **Problem:** Payment gateway downtime (average 99.7% uptime = 2 hours/month unavailable)
   - Receive confirmation → **Problem:** 5% of confirmation emails land in spam
   - Track status → **Problem:** Status updates lag 4-24 hours behind actual processing
   - Receive outcome → **Problem:** Rejection letters unclear about how to appeal

2. **FRONTSTAGE INTERACTIONS** (Visible to citizen)
   - Website/mobile app interface → **Performance:** 3.5-second median load time (target: <2s), 18% bounce rate
   - Chatbot assistance → **Effectiveness:** Resolves 55% of queries without human escalation (vendor claimed 80%)
   - Email/SMS notifications → **Cost:** $0.02-0.05 per SMS adds up (10M transactions = $200-500K annually)
   - Service desk support → **Capacity:** Average 15-minute hold time during peak periods
   - Physical office visit → **Reality:** 20-30% of digital services still require in-person visit for edge cases

3. **BACKSTAGE PROCESSES** (Invisible to citizen)
   - Identity verification → **Failure rate:** 8-12% require manual review (name mismatches, data quality issues)
   - Eligibility check → **Error rate:** Rules engine has 3-5% error rate due to ambiguous policy interpretation
   - Document validation → **Processing time:** AI processes 70% instantly; 30% require 2-5 day manual review
   - Inter-agency data exchange → **Latency:** 200ms to 8-second response times depending on source system load
   - Quality assurance review → **Bottleneck:** QA team can review 50-80 cases/day; application rate often exceeds capacity

4. **SUPPORTING SYSTEMS** (Technical)
   - Digital identity system → **Dependency risk:** If identity system is down, ALL services are unavailable
   - Legacy database integration → **The hard part:** 60% of backend integration effort is translating between legacy systems with inconsistent data models
   - Payment gateway → **Vendor lock-in:** Switching payment providers requires 6-12 month migration
   - Notifications service → **Deliverability:** Email 92-96% delivered, SMS 96-99%, push notifications 85-90%

**Blueprint Example: Birth Registration Service**

```
Citizen Actions:        [Research] → [Authenticate] → [Fill Form] → [Upload Docs] → [Submit] → [Track] → [Receive Certificate]
                              ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓          ↓            ↓
Frontstage:            [Website] → [Login Portal] → [Smart Form] → [Upload UI] → [Confirm] → [Status Page] → [Download]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Backstage:                    [ID Verify] → [Prefill Data] → [Validate Docs] → [Auto-approve / Manual Review] → [Generate Cert]
                                   ↓              ↓                 ↓                      ↓                           ↓
Supporting Systems:    [Digital ID] + [Population Registry] + [Hospital System] + [Case Mgmt] + [Notifications] + [Archive]
```

**Service Blueprint Tool**: Use free tools like Miro, Figma, or draw.io with service blueprint templates

---

### 5.3.3 Co-Design with Citizens

**Why Co-Design Matters:**

Services designed BY citizens FOR citizens achieve:
- **30-50% higher adoption** rates
- **40-60% fewer support calls** (intuitive design)
- **20-35% faster processing** (fewer errors)
- **Higher trust and satisfaction** (citizens feel heard)

**Co-Design Process** (8-week cycle):

**Week 1-2: DISCOVER**
- Recruit diverse citizen panel (15-25 people representing different demographics)
- Conduct interviews and shadowing
- Map current "as-is" journey
- Identify pain points and opportunities

**Week 3-4: DEFINE**
- Synthesize research findings
- Create personas representing citizen segments
- Define design principles (e.g., "mobile-first," "one page, one question," "plain language")
- Prioritize problems to solve

**Week 5-6: DESIGN**
- Co-design workshops with citizen panel
- Sketch and prototype multiple solutions
- Test paper prototypes
- Iterate based on feedback

**Week 7-8: DELIVER (Alpha)**
- Build interactive prototype
- User acceptance testing with citizen panel
- Refine based on feedback
- Prepare for beta launch

**Post-Launch: ITERATE**
- Ongoing feedback collection
- Analytics review (drop-off points, errors)
- Quarterly service reviews with citizen panel
- Continuous improvement

- **Examples**: Mobile app issue while web works, specific document type upload failing
- **Target Response**: 2 hours (acknowledge), 8 hours (resolution)
- **Escalation**: Service Manager handles, escalate if unresolved in 6 hours
- **Communication**: Status page update within 2 hours

**P4 - LOW (Minor Issue)**
- **Definition**: Cosmetic issues, minor bugs, low-impact problems
- **Examples**: Spelling errors, formatting issues, non-critical link broken
- **Target Response**: 1 business day (acknowledge), 5 business days (resolution)
- **Escalation**: Handled by support team, no escalation needed
- **Communication**: No public communication unless user-reported
