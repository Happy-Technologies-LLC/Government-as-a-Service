## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: PROCESS BEFORE TECHNOLOGY

**The 40-40-20 PPT Framework**

- **40% PEOPLE**: Volume I - talent, culture, change, leadership ✅
- **40% PROCESS**: **This volume** - service management, process design, governance
- **20% TECHNOLOGY**: Volume III - platforms, infrastructure, tools

**Why Process Comes Second**:
1. **People define what's needed**: Services must meet citizen needs, not technology capabilities
2. **Process defines how it works**: Well-designed processes ensure services are reliable, efficient, equitable
3. **Technology enables at scale**: Platforms automate optimized processes, not broken ones

**Cardinal Rule**: Never automate a broken process. Redesign first, then digitize.

# CHAPTER 5: GSM SERVICE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

## 5.1 INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNMENT SERVICE MANAGEMENT (GSM)

### 5.1.1 What is GSM?

**Government Service Management (GSM)** is a purpose-built framework for managing digital government services. While inspired by IT Service Management (ITSM) best practices, GSM is tailored to the unique context of government: citizen-centricity, democratic accountability, equity, transparency, and public value creation.

**GSM is NOT:**
- Corporate ITSM/ITIL adapted for government
- Just technology service management
- Only for IT departments

**GSM IS:**
- Purpose-built for whole-of-government service delivery
- Citizen outcomes and public value focused
- Democratic accountability and transparency embedded
- Equity and inclusion as core principles
- Cross-agency collaboration enabled

**Why GSM Matters:**

Without formal service management, governments experience:
- ❌ Frequent service disruptions (avg. 99.2% uptime = 7 hours downtime/month)
- ❌ No clear service levels or citizen commitments
- ❌ Reactive incident response (firefighting)
- ❌ Recurring problems never addressed at root cause
- ❌ Uncontrolled changes causing instability
- ❌ No systematic improvement

With GSM, governments achieve:
- ✅ 99.9%+ uptime (52 minutes downtime/year)
- ✅ Clear SLAs with citizen commitments
- ✅ Proactive incident prevention and rapid resolution
- ✅ Root cause analysis eliminating recurring issues
- ✅ Controlled changes balancing innovation and stability
- ✅ Continual improvement culture

## 5.2 SERVICE STRATEGY: DEFINING THE CITIZEN-CENTRIC SERVICE PORTFOLIO

### 5.2.1 Service Catalog Design

**What is a Service Catalog?**

A service catalog is the authoritative source listing all services government provides to citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. It answers: "What services does government offer?" and "How do I access them?"

**Two-Layer Catalog Model:**

**Layer 1: SERVICE CATALOG (Citizen-Facing)**
- Lists services in plain language citizens understand
- Organizes by life events, not government departments
- Shows eligibility, channels, costs, service levels

**Layer 2: TECHNICAL CATALOG (Internal)**
- Shows underlying components and dependencies
- Lists APIs, databases, integrations required
- Tracks service owners and support teams

**Service Catalog Template:**

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Service Name** | "Register a Birth" | Plain language, citizen-understood |
| **Service ID** | SVC-001 | Unique identifier for tracking |
| **Service Description** | "Register the birth of your child to obtain a birth certificate. Required for passport, school enrollment, and benefits." | Clear purpose and outcomes |
| **Life Event** | Birth & Family | Groups related services |
| **Eligibility** | "Parents of child born in [Country]" | Who can use this |
| **Channels** | Online (24/7), Mobile App, In-Person (8am-5pm Mon-Fri) | How to access |
| **Service Level** | Tier 1 (Critical) - 99.9% uptime, 24-hour processing | Commitments |
| **Cost** | Free | Price transparency |
| **Service Owner** | Ministry of Health - John Smith | Accountability |
| **Dependencies** | Population Registry (SVC-020), Digital Identity (SVC-002) | Technical linkages |
| **Related Services** | Apply for Passport (SVC-015), Enroll in Healthcare (SVC-030) | Journey connections |

---

### 5.2.2 Service Portfolio Hierarchy & Cost Visibility

**Beyond the Basic Catalog: Hierarchical Service Portfolios**

While the two-layer catalog above provides citizen-facing and technical views, **service portfolio management** adds a critical financial and governance dimension inspired by ITIL Service Portfolio Management, ServiceNow's Common Services Data Model (CSDM), and Technology Business Management (TBM) frameworks.

**The 5-Level Service Hierarchy:**

Modern service portfolio management decomposes services from the business level down to infrastructure, enabling complete cost transparency and impact analysis:

**Level 1: Business Services** (Citizen-Facing)
- Example: "Healthcare Insurance Service"
- What citizens see and use
- Organized by service domains (Healthcare, Education, Justice, etc.)

**Level 2: Technical Services** (Supporting Backend)
- Example: "Eligibility Verification Service," "Claims Processing Service"
- Backend services that support business services
- Often consumed by multiple business services

**Level 3: Applications**
- Example: "Healthcare Portal (React)," "Claims API (Java)," "Provider Directory (PostgreSQL)"
- Software systems delivering technical services
- Tracked in CMDB with version control

**Level 4: Infrastructure**
- Example: "50 EC2 instances," "2TB RDS storage," "CloudFront CDN"
- Compute, storage, network resources supporting applications
- Mapped to cost allocation

**Level 5: Cost Allocation** (PPT Breakdown)
- People: FTE costs allocated to service (e.g., 100 FTE @ $200K fully-loaded = $20M)
- Process: Service management operations, compliance, QA (e.g., $15M)
- Technology: Infrastructure + software + cloud costs (e.g., $10M)

**Why This Matters: The "Healthcare IT" Question**

Without hierarchical service portfolios, executives cannot answer: "How much does Healthcare IT cost us?" or "What happens to infrastructure if we expand healthcare insurance services?"

With service portfolio management:
- **Cost Visibility**: "Healthcare domain IT costs $120M/year, Education $80M/year"
- **Impact Analysis**: "Expanding healthcare insurance by 100K users requires 15 additional servers, $2.5M infrastructure"
- **Isolated Governance**: Healthcare CIO owns healthcare services, budgets, and infrastructure
- **PPT Balance Tracking**: Monitor 40-40-20 investment by service domain

**Service Domain Governance Model:**

| Domain | Annual IT Budget | Services | Dedicated FTE | Infrastructure |
|--------|-----------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Healthcare | $120M | Insurance, Research, Public Health | 50 FTE | Healthcare-specific servers |
| Education | $80M | K-12, Higher Ed, Scholarships | 30 FTE | Education portals, LMS |
| Justice | $60M | Courts, Prisons, Legal Aid | 25 FTE | Case management systems |
| Shared Services | $50M | Digital Identity, Payments | 40 FTE | Cross-domain platforms |

**Implementation Note:** See **Tier 3 Playbook #10: Service Portfolio & Cost Management** for complete implementation guidance including TBM cost allocation methodology, service hierarchy templates, and 18-month roadmap.

**Integration with ServiceNow CMDB:**
- Configuration Items (CIs) mapped to applications and infrastructure
- Service relationships tracked (Business Service → Technical Service → Application → CI)
- Cost allocation automated through CMDB attributes
- Impact analysis powered by service dependency mapping

---

### 5.2.3 Service Classification Framework

**Not all services are equal—classify by criticality and volume to allocate resources appropriately:**

**TIER 1: CRITICAL SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: Essential for daily life, high citizen dependency, safety/security impact
- **Examples**: Digital Identity, Emergency Services, Healthcare Access, Social Benefits
- **Service Level**: 99.99% uptime (52 min/year downtime), 24/7 support, <1 hour P1 incident response
- **Investment**: Premium infrastructure, 24/7 operations, redundancy, monitoring
- **Volume**: Typically 5-10 services

**TIER 2: HIGH-VOLUME SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: High transaction volume, significant citizen touchpoints, economic impact
- **Examples**: Tax Filing, Business Registration, Vehicle Registration, Visa Applications
- **Service Level**: 99.9% uptime (8 hours/year downtime), business hours support, <4 hour P1 response
- **Investment**: Robust infrastructure, dedicated support team, scaling capability
- **Volume**: Typically 15-30 services

**TIER 3: STANDARD SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: Regular use, moderate volume, standard importance
- **Examples**: License Renewals, Permit Applications, Information Requests
- **Service Level**: 99.5% uptime (1.8 days/year), business hours support, <8 hour P1 response
- **Investment**: Shared infrastructure, standard operations, basic monitoring
- **Volume**: Typically 50-100 services

**TIER 4: LOW-VOLUME SERVICES**
- **Criteria**: Infrequent use, niche audiences, low criticality
- **Examples**: Special Permits, Archive Requests, Historical Records
- **Service Level**: 99% uptime (3.6 days/year), email support, <24 hour P1 response
- **Investment**: Minimal infrastructure, self-service emphasis, basic support
- **Volume**: Typically 100-500 services

**Resource Allocation Rule**: Tier 1 services receive 40% of operational budget despite being only 1-2% of service count

## 5.3 SERVICE DESIGN & CO-CREATION

### 5.3.1 Citizen-Centric Service Design Methodology

**Traditional Government Approach** (Department-Centric):
- ❌ Organized by ministry/agency structure
- ❌ Citizens navigate complex org charts
- ❌ Multiple touchpoints for single life event
- ❌ Redundant data collection across agencies
- ❌ One-size-fits-all processes

**GSM Approach** (Citizen-Centric):
- ✅ Organized by life events and citizen journeys
- ✅ Single service for complex life events
- ✅ Once-only data principle (tell us once)
- ✅ Personalized based on eligibility and needs
- ✅ Co-designed with actual citizens

---

### 5.3.2 Service Blueprinting

**Service Blueprint Components:**

1. **CITIZEN ACTIONS** (What citizen does)
   - Research eligibility
   - Create account / authenticate
   - Fill application form
   - Upload documents
   - Submit and pay
   - Receive confirmation
   - Track status
   - Receive outcome

2. **FRONTSTAGE INTERACTIONS** (Visible to citizen)
   - Website/mobile app interface
   - Chatbot assistance
   - Email/SMS notifications
   - Service desk support (phone, chat)
   - Physical office visit (if needed)

3. **BACKSTAGE PROCESSES** (Invisible to citizen)
   - Identity verification (automated)
   - Eligibility check (rules engine)
   - Document validation (AI + manual review)
   - Payment processing
   - Inter-agency data exchange
   - Quality assurance review
   - Certificate generation
   - Archive and audit logging

4. **SUPPORTING SYSTEMS** (Technical)
   - Digital identity system
   - Forms engine

   - Data warehouse

**Blueprint Example: Birth Registration Service**

```
Citizen Actions:        [Research] → [Authenticate] → [Fill Form] → [Upload Docs] → [Submit] → [Track] → [Receive Certificate]
                              ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓          ↓            ↓
Frontstage:            [Website] → [Login Portal] → [Smart Form] → [Upload UI] → [Confirm] → [Status Page] → [Download]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Backstage:                    [ID Verify] → [Prefill Data] → [Validate Docs] → [Auto-approve / Manual Review] → [Generate Cert]
                                   ↓              ↓                 ↓                      ↓                           ↓
Supporting Systems:    [Digital ID] + [Population Registry] + [Hospital System] + [Case Mgmt] + [Notifications] + [Archive]
```

**Service Blueprint Tool**: Use free tools like Miro, Figma, or draw.io with service blueprint templates

### 5.3.3 Co-Design with Citizens

**Why Co-Design Matters:**

Services designed BY citizens FOR citizens achieve:
- **30-50% higher adoption** rates
- **40-60% fewer support calls** (intuitive design)
- **20-35% faster processing** (fewer errors)
- **Higher trust and satisfaction** (citizens feel heard)

**Co-Design Process** (8-week cycle):

**Week 1-2: DISCOVER**
- Recruit diverse citizen panel (15-25 people representing different demographics)
- Conduct interviews and shadowing
- Map current "as-is" journey
- Identify pain points and opportunities

**Week 3-4: DEFINE**
- Synthesize research findings
- Create personas representing citizen segments
- Define design principles (e.g., "mobile-first," "one page, one question," "plain language")
- Prioritize problems to solve

**Week 5-6: DESIGN**
- Co-design workshops with citizen panel
- Sketch and prototype multiple solutions
- Test paper prototypes
- Iterate based on feedback

**Week 7-8: DELIVER (Alpha)**
- Build interactive prototype
- User acceptance testing with citizen panel
- Refine based on feedback
- Prepare for beta launch

**Post-Launch: ITERATE**
- Ongoing feedback collection
- Analytics review (drop-off points, errors)
- Quarterly service reviews with citizen panel
- Continuous improvement
