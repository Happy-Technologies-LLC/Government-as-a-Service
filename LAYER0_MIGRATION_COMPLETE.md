## Layer 0 Landing Page Features

The new `layer0-overview.md` (23,320 bytes) provides:

### 1. Strategic Framing
- **"Policy is not a downstream consideration. Policy is the foundation."**
- Explains why Layer 0 comes first in the new architecture
- Links philosophical justification (GaaS Manifesto) with legal authority (legislative templates)

### 2. Complete Policy Catalog
Organized into 4 categories:
- **Core Legislative Framework (3 essential)**: Digital Identity Act, Data Protection Act, E-Government Services Act
- **Enabling Policy Framework (7 highly recommended)**: Cybersecurity, Open Data, Digital Strategy, etc.
- **Operational Policy Templates (16 sector-specific)**: Cloud-first, API Governance, Service Management, etc.

### 3. Implementation Guidance
- **Sequencing roadmap**: 4-phase implementation over 36 months
- **Integration with other layers**: How Layer 0 enables/constrains Layers 1-4
- **Implementation checklist**: Legal readiness, policy framework, governance, capability
- **Common pitfalls**: 6 failure patterns with prevention strategies
- **Success indicators**: Measurable outcomes for legal authority, institutional capacity, citizen trust

### 4. Practical Support
- How to use the templates (assess, prioritize, adapt, sequence)
- Adaptation guidance for different contexts (federal vs. unitary, high/middle/low income)
- Resources for policymakers, legal teams, implementers, international organizations

## Content Migration

### Source Content
- **From Tier 4** (Policy & Legal Templates): All 26 legislative/policy templates
- **From Tier 0** (Manifesto): Referenced as philosophical justification

### Key Reframing
1. **Tier 4 → Layer 0**: Policy moved from "implementation detail" to "foundation"
2. **Manifesto integration**: The "why" (Manifesto) now explicitly justifies the "how" (legislation)
3. **Architectural positioning**: Layer 0 now explicitly shown as enabling Layers 1-4

---

## Architectural Coherence

### Layer 0 Role in New Architecture

**Layer 0: Legal & Policy Foundation** (bedrock)
↓ *enables*
**Layer 1: Shared Technology Core** (infrastructure)
↓ *serves*
**Layer 2: People & Process Engine** (organizational capability)
↓ *manages*
**Layer 3: Transparent Service Portfolio** (service catalog + cost transparency)
↓ *delivers*
**Layer 4: Unified Citizen Experience** (seamless, personalized services)

### Cross-Layer Integration Documented

The landing page explicitly maps how Layer 0:
- **Enables** each layer (e.g., Digital Identity Act → Layer 1 identity infrastructure)
- **Constrains** each layer (e.g., Data Protection Act → Layer 1 must encrypt, log, consent)
- **Coordinates** across layers (e.g., Chief Digital Officer governs all layers)

---

## Key Innovations in Landing Page

### 1. Political Framing
- Not technocratic, but democratic imperative
- Manifesto provides moral/political justification for legal frameworks
- Addresses "What gives government the right to pursue radical transformation?"

### 2. Phased Implementation
- Clear 4-phase sequencing (Foundation → Operational → Governance → Refinement)
- Recognizes not all legislation needed simultaneously
- Provides practical timeline (36 months to full implementation)

### 3. Risk Mitigation
- 6 common failure patterns with prevention strategies:
  1. Legislation without enforcement (budget + oversight required)
  2. Technology before law (legal framework first)
  3. Privacy as afterthought (privacy by design from day one)
  4. Digital-only exclusion (assisted digital + alternatives)
  5. Weak central coordination (strong Chief Digital Officer)
  6. Ignoring international standards (adopt ISO/NIST/eIDAS)

### 4. Success Metrics
- Legal authority (digital signatures legally valid, etc.)
- Institutional capacity (Chief Digital Officer has budget/veto)
- Citizen trust (>70% identity adoption, >60% service usage)
- International recognition (adequacy decisions, top-20 UN EGDI ranking)

## Next Steps for Framework

With Layer 0 complete, the migration continues:

1. ✅ **Layer 0: Legal & Policy Foundation** (COMPLETE)
2. **Layer 1: Shared Technology Core** (Next - migrate Tier 2 technical blueprints)
3. **Layer 2: People & Process Engine** (Tier 3 playbooks + Tier 2 people/org content)
4. **Layer 3: Transparent Service Portfolio** (Tier 1 executive playbook as portfolio management)
5. **Layer 4: Unified Citizen Experience** (Tier 5 community hub as co-design mechanism)

## Files Modified

- **Created**: `/Version 1.0/docs/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/layer0-overview.md`
- **Copied**: All 26 files from `tier4-policy-legal/` to `layer0-legal-policy-foundation/`
- **Total new/modified**: 27 files

---

## Validation

Directory structure verified:
```bash
$ ls -la Version\ 1.0/docs/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/ | wc -l
29  # (27 files + . + ..)
```

Landing page size:
```bash
$ wc -c Version\ 1.0/docs/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/layer0-overview.md
23320
```

All policy templates present:
```bash
$ ls Version\ 1.0/docs/layer0-legal-policy-foundation/*.md | wc -l
27
```

## Quality Indicators

### Comprehensiveness
- ✅ All 26 policy templates migrated
- ✅ Manifesto integrated as philosophical foundation
- ✅ Complete implementation guidance
- ✅ Cross-layer integration documented

### Usability
- ✅ Clear executive summary
- ✅ Organized by priority (core → enabling → operational)
- ✅ Practical checklists and roadmaps
- ✅ Real-world examples and failure patterns

### Strategic Alignment
- ✅ Positions policy as foundation, not afterthought
- ✅ Links political vision (Manifesto) to legal authority (legislation)
- ✅ Enables integrated operating model (not tier-based silos)
- ✅ Supports international interoperability

## Migration Agent Notes

**Task**: Create Layer 0: Legal & Policy Foundation structure
**Source Content**: Tier 4 (policy) + Tier 0 (manifesto)
**Deliverables**: Complete directory + comprehensive landing page
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Key Achievement**: Successfully reframed policy from Tier 4 "implementation detail" to Layer 0 "foundational bedrock," establishing legal authority as the prerequisite for all digital transformation.
