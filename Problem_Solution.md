# The GaaS Operating Model: Problem & Solution

## The Problem: The High Cost of Fragmentation

Traditional governments are structured as a collection of rigid, independent siloes, each with its own budget, culture, and technology stack. This industrial-era model is now the single biggest barrier to progress.

This fragmentation forces citizens to navigate a complex, fragmented, and opaque bureaucracy, where they must re-introduce themselves at every "door." It also forces public servants to operate with one hand tied, battling legacy systems and redundant processes.

So-called "digital transformation" has historically failed because it simply automates these existing siloes. This approach is a dead end. It creates a disjointed user experience, locks in massive technical debt, and makes it impossible for leaders to see the true relationship between cost and public value.

## The Solution: A Unified Operating System

We are not building another app or website. We are building a complete, integrated **Government as a Service (GaaS) Operating Model**.

This solution reframes government as a single, service-driven platform. It provides a "full-stack" blueprint built from two fully integrated parts:

1.  **The GaaS Architectural Framework:** This is the *structural blueprint* that defines the core components of the government (People, Process, Policy, and Technology).

2.  **The GaaS Service Value System (GSVS):** This is the *dynamic process engine* (inspired by ITIL) that runs *on* that framework, showing the end-to-end flow of turning a public mandate into a valuable public service.

### 1. The GaaS Architectural Framework (The Structure)

This **Architectural Framework** is defined by five core layers, building from the ground up:

* **Layer 0: The Legal & Policy Foundation** that enables digital operations.
* **Layer 1: The Shared Technology Core** ("build once, use everywhere" platforms like digital identity and payments).
* **Layer 2: The People & Process Engine** (the skilled workforce and service management processes that run the system).
* **Layer 3: The Transparent Service Portfolio** (the "what" the government does, managed for cost and value).
* **Layer 4: The Unified Citizen Experience** (the single "front-door" for all services).

### 2. The GaaS Service Value System (The Process Engine)

This architecture is brought to life by the **GaaS Service Value System (GSVS)**. This is the clear, repeatable process that shows how the components of the framework work together to co-create value. It consists of five key parts:

* **Guiding Principles:** The core philosophy (e.g., "design for the citizen," "radical transparency") that guides all decisions within the system.
* **Governance:** The "steering wheel" of the system. This is how leaders direct and control the framework, using tools like TBM for financial transparency and the service portfolio (Layer 3) to make strategic decisions.
* **The Service Value Chain:** This is the central "engine" of value creation. It's an end-to-end flow:
    1.  **Mandate:** A new policy (from Layer 0) or public need is identified.
    2.  **Architect:** A solution is designed using the **Core Blueprints** (from Layer 1).
    3.  **Build/Acquire:** The service is built by the teams (in Layer 2) using Agile playbooks.
    4.  **Transition:** The service is tested and released using the ITIL playbooks (from Layer 2).
    5.  **Deliver & Support:** The service is now live in the **Portfolio** (Layer 3), accessed via the **Experience** (Layer 4), and supported by the Service Desk (in Layer 2).
* **Practice & Blueprint Library:** The "toolbox" of assets (from Layers 1 and 2) that are pulled into the Service Value Chain to do the work.
* **Continual Improvement:** The feedback loop. Data from citizen engagement (Layer 4) and service performance is used to improve the entire system, from the blueprints to the principles.
