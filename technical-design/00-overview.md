# GaaS Platform - Technical Design Overview

**Project Name:** GaaS Platform (Government as a Service Platform)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Design Phase
**License:** AGPLv3 (Copyleft for public good)

---

## Executive Summary

This document series describes the technical architecture for **GaaS Platform** - an open-source government service management platform purpose-built for digital government transformation. The platform implements the Government Service Management (GSM) framework based on ITIL and ISO 20000 standards, enabling governments to achieve the 40-40-20 PPT (People-Process-Technology) balance principle.

### Vision Statement

> To provide every government worldwide—regardless of size or budget—with a world-class, open-source platform for managing digital services, achieving cost transparency, and delivering citizen-centric government.

### Open Source Commitment

**GaaS Platform is 100% open source and always will be:**

- ✅ **AGPLv3 License:** Strong copyleft ensures derivative works remain open
- ✅ **No Commercial Version:** No "enterprise edition" with locked features
- ✅ **No Vendor Lock-In:** Data export, standard APIs, portable architecture
- ✅ **No License Fees:** Zero cost forever, no per-user or per-service pricing
- ✅ **Community Governed:** Decisions made transparently by Technical Steering Committee
- ✅ **Public Roadmap:** Development priorities set by community and government users

**What This Means:**
- Governments own their platform and data completely
- No recurring costs or vendor negotiations
- Modifications stay within government or contributed back to community
- Source code auditable for security and transparency
- Compatible with government transparency and sovereignty requirements

### Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Commercial ITSM platforms cost $50M-500M+ for government-scale deployments
- Proprietary platforms lock governments into vendor dependency and recurring license fees
- Generic ITSM tools lack government-specific features (service portfolio hierarchy, domain isolation, PPT tracking)
- No open-source platform enforces the GSM framework and 40-40-20 principle
- Governments cannot achieve "Healthcare IT: $120M/year, Education: $80M/year" cost visibility
- Closed-source systems prevent transparency and community-driven improvements

**Desired State:**
- Free, open-source platform available to all governments
- Community-driven development with government-specific features
- Complete cost transparency from citizen services to infrastructure
- Built-in GSM best practices and governance
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting domain isolation
- API-first design enabling ecosystem integration

### Success Criteria

**Technical Metrics (Year 1):**
- Platform deployed in 5+ governments (pilot phase)
- 10,000+ services managed across all deployments
- 99.9%+ uptime SLA achieved
- Sub-second response times for 95% of requests
- 100+ external contributors to codebase

**Business Metrics (Year 3):**
- 30+ government production deployments
- 50+ certified implementation partners (supporting deployment/training, not selling licenses)
- $100M+ in proprietary ITSM license costs avoided
- Active open-source community (1,000+ members)
- Fork/derivative platforms for specialized use cases (all open source under AGPLv3)

**Impact Metrics (Year 5):**
- Platform used by 100M+ citizens globally
- $1B+ in documented cost savings for governments
- Contributed to 20+ countries achieving top-50 UN E-Government Index ranking
- Recognized by World Bank/ITU/OECD as standard platform
