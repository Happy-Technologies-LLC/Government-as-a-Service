# Changes Summary - Open Source Cleanup

**Date:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Remove all proprietary product references and strengthen open-source positioning

---

## What Changed

### 1. Removed Proprietary Product References

**Before:**
- "open-source alternative to ServiceNow"
- "ServiceNow, BMC, etc."
- "ServiceNow CSDM: Common Services Data Model"
- "Jira/ServiceNow migration tools"

**After:**
- "open-source government service management platform"
- "commercial ITSM platforms"
- "ITIL Service Portfolio standards"
- "commercial platform migration tools"

### 2. Strengthened Open Standards Foundation

**Added references to:**
- ✅ ITIL v4 (IT Service Management framework)
- ✅ ISO/IEC 20000 (International standard for ITSM)
- ✅ COBIT (Control Objectives for IT)
- ✅ TBM Framework (Technology Business Management - open standard)
- ✅ Estonia's X-Road (open-source data exchange)

**Why:** GaaS Platform is built on open international standards, not proprietary methodologies

### 3. Added "Open Source Commitment" Section

**New content in 00-overview.md:**
- AGPLv3 license commitment
- No commercial version pledge
- No vendor lock-in guarantee
- Community governance model
- What this means for governments

### 4. Created OPEN-SOURCE-PRINCIPLES.md

**New 500+ line document covering:**
- Why AGPLv3 (network copyleft explained)
- What GaaS Platform will NEVER do (no enterprise edition, no per-user fees)
- Business model (non-profit foundation, certified partners)
- Why open source matters for government
- Governance model (Technical Steering Committee)
- Migration from commercial platforms
- Long-term sustainability plan

### 5. Updated Acknowledgments

**Before:**
- Mentioned ServiceNow CSDM as inspiration

**After:**
- Focus on open standards (ITIL, ISO 20000, COBIT, TBM)
- Government implementations (Estonia X-Road - open source)
- Open-source communities (Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### 6. Clarified Success Metrics

**Changed:**
- "$100M+ in commercial ITSM costs displaced" → "$100M+ in proprietary ITSM license costs avoided"
- "50+ certified implementation partners" → "50+ certified implementation partners (supporting deployment/training, not selling licenses)"

**Why:** Emphasize cost savings and clarify that partners provide services, not licenses
