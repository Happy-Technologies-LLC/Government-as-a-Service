## üìã Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive technical design for **GaaS Platform** - an open-source government service management platform purpose-built for digital government transformation. The platform implements the Government Service Management (GSM) framework based on ITIL and ISO 20000 standards, enabling the 40-40-20 PPT (People-Process-Technology) balance principle.

### Vision

> To provide every government worldwide‚Äîregardless of size or budget‚Äîwith a world-class, open-source platform for managing digital services, achieving cost transparency, and delivering citizen-centric government.
