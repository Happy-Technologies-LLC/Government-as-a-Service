# Multi-Agent Swarm Mission Report
## People-Process-Technology Integration for GaaS

**Mission ID**: swarm_1760967559442_r52g89q8j
**Topology**: Hierarchical (Queen-led coordination)
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Duration**: Single coordinated session

## Mission Objective

Transform the Government as a Service (GaaS) framework from **technology-centric** to **balanced People-Process-Technology** approach, with Government Service Management (GSM) at its core.
