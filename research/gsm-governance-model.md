# Government Service Management (GSM) Governance Model

## Executive Summary

The GSM Governance Model establishes a comprehensive framework for ensuring balanced investment and focus across People, Process, and Technology dimensions. This model prevents the common pitfall of technology-centric transformation by institutionalizing governance mechanisms that enforce a 40-40-20 investment ratio (People:Process:Technology) and ensuring that all three pillars receive equal strategic attention.

### Key Principles
1. **Balanced Investment**: No single dimension can dominate resource allocation
2. **Integrated Decision-Making**: All major decisions consider PPT impact
3. **Measurable Accountability**: Clear metrics for each dimension
4. **Adaptive Governance**: Quarterly rebalancing based on outcomes
5. **Stakeholder Representation**: All constituencies have voice in governance

## 10. Conclusion

The GSM Governance Model provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring balanced People-Process-Technology investment and transformation. By institutionalizing:

1. **Clear Governance Structure**: Multi-tier governance with defined roles, authorities, and accountabilities
2. **Balance Mechanisms**: Systematic monitoring and rebalancing to maintain 40-40-20 PPT ratio
3. **Integrated Decision-Making**: Cross-dimensional collaboration and holistic decision-making
4. **Robust Policies**: Comprehensive policies spanning service management, workforce, and technology
5. **Measurable Accountability**: Clear metrics and performance management across all dimensions

This model prevents the common pitfall of technology-centric digital transformation and ensures that people and process receive the strategic attention and investment they deserve.

**Success Criteria**:
- Maintain PPT investment ratio within ±5% of target consistently
- Achieve 80%+ governance effectiveness rating
- Demonstrate balanced outcomes across all three dimensions
- Establish mature governance (Level 4-5) within 18 months
- Become reference model for GSM governance globally

**Next Steps**:
1. Approve governance charter and structure (Steering Committee)
2. Appoint governance body members (within 30 days)
3. Conduct governance launch and training (Month 1)
4. Establish baseline and initial targets (Month 1)
5. Activate governance operations (Month 2)
6. Conduct first quarterly balance review (Month 3)
